        <title>Excellent read for anyone operating an OP-based rollup. 

Key takeaways:
- Reth&apos;s good!
- Still, its solution to DB compactions &quot;sacrifices&quot; historical proof and root calculation speed. Versioned Merkle Trees like Jellyfish and specialized storages like LETUS remain much superior to MPT and MDBX.

- Full nodes forking onto their chain can happen easier than one may think. Operations are as important if not even more than core Systems works üôÇ.</title>

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: Popular L2s still don‚Äôt scale.

L2s can‚Äôt handle Solana-level throughput even if they wanted to, let alone a few thousand TPS. Significant growth threatens to exhaust Ethereum‚Äôs data throughput indefinitely.

Building for Gigagas performance requires a different approach, so RISE is building with Celestia underneath. ü¶£

Celestia plays a pivotal role in enabling RISE to achieve Gigagas throughput, which is over ONE HUNDRED TIMES more performance than popular Ethereum L2s like Base.

Blockchain performance, especially transaction processing speed, has long been severely undermined by three major bottlenecks: 

Data Availability, Execution, and State Access; leading to many failed attempts at launching truly scalable blockchains.

With Celestia, high performance Data Availability (DA) is now possible:

‚Ä¢ 1.33 MB/s on public testnet (expected on Mainnet in January), enough to handle Gigagas chains while remaining permissionless

‚Ä¢ Cheaper transactions, with DA costs as low as $0.00002 per transfer

‚Ä¢ A roadmap to 1GB/s of data throughput, including through new cryptographic breakthroughs like ZODA (https://x.com/celestia/status/1864012479980024278)

‚Ä¢ Proven reliability after a year in production and nearly 25 chains posting data to Celestia today

While Celestia removes the DA bottleneck, RISE tackles the Execution and State Access bottlenecks. Together, this makes RISE chain‚Äôs Gigagas performance a reality - bringing unstoppable, extreme performance to everyone.

No more slow transactions, network congestion and high fees - even at mass adoption.

This isn‚Äôt just incremental progress. RISE chain removes the final barriers to scale, at extreme scale, and will enable onchain applications to outcompete their centralized counterparts:

‚Ä¢ DeFi with CEX-level speed and liquidity
‚Ä¢ Fully on-chain apps supporting millions of real-time users
‚Ä¢ On-chain AI networks that run without congestion

With Celestia‚Äôs DA and RISE‚Äôs Execution and State Access breakthroughs, the Gigagas Era is here: reliable, decentralized, and over 100x faster.

The future of unstoppable performance starts now.

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: Reth v1.1.3 is out -- smol updates, but most importantly breaking changes in the library API, setting us up for Reth as a type-abstracted SDK for building nodes...similar to Cosmos SDK and Substrate, but for the Rollup-centric roadmap.

so far you&apos;ve been able to overload payload building, txpool, rpcs, the runtime w/ evm or other state transition functions, soon you&apos;ll be able to define custom transaction &amp; block types, setting up for innovation and unprecedented customization for both research and product differentiation

        <title>100%. 

Like with Rust traits, we should define minimal core methods that a meaningful program would call from the abstraction. We may tolerate some good-to-haves if they have good defaults. Otherwise, it&apos;s best to provide these extras in each different implementation.

The same is true for Reth! The current TransactionPool trait requires 44 methods! Several are for blobs that most L2s don&apos;t support. Or when PayloadJob asks for methods only relevant to block-building with slow block times. We either need to provide frictional implementations that we should not need, or panic and pray the Lord that underlying Reth will not call them in a new release.

Will suggest and upstream improvements ü´°.</title>

        <title>NGL I wish Web3 is represented more by heavy music than sad memecoins.

When I first read about the rebellious movement in 2017 I immediately thought of Systems of a Down, Rage Against the Machine, and Megadeth.

After several years I&apos;m still the only one writing blazingly fast bugs while headbanging at work. Everyone asks &quot;what is the ticker&quot; (true story) but not &quot;what is the band&quot;, &quot;what is the ideal&quot;? 

Are you fighting the system like Systems and Rage, or are you fighting your inner pain like Grunge? What drives you to work tomorrow?

Not asking everyone to look like a depressed addict at the next conference, but surely the Web3 image can be more Cypherpunky and purposeful ü§î.</title>

        <title>An underrated design space in high-performance chains is the mempool.

Intuitively, one must insert 100k new transactions every second to maintain 100k TPS throughput. 

A naive implementation would be congested with each new transaction competing for write access. Batching this wrong would lead to poor latency as queued transaction submissions block new ones.

Another trap is to have transaction insertions starve write access for canonical state updates, which blocks the building of the next block as the mempool is not yet ready.

At @rise_chain, we&apos;re optimizing the Reth mempool and customizing it for high load and low block time (have we mentioned sharding??). 
The end game is to build a DAG-based mempool that estimates state access at transaction insertion time, to minimize state conflicts for the Parallel-EVM block builder to go brr.

We&apos;ll upstream as much to Reth as possible and open-source the RISE Mempool in Q2/2025. Reach out if mempools fascinate you too üòÅ!</title>

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: I will be around @EFDevcon Wednesday/Thursday and down to chat about Revm.

And super hyped for the &quot;Revm endgame&quot; talk, I will tell a story of its beginning and more importantly its final endgame stage.</title>
