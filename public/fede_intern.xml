        <title>RT by @fede_intern: This is an interesting argument! ðŸ˜€ I still struggle to get bullish because I think that it ignores the cost of prover decentralization and suffers from the misconception that an efficient market requires a blockchain. 

First, I don&apos;t think anyone is arguing that prover networks shouldn&apos;t exist because everyone will use AWS and GCP, just that censorship-resistance isn&apos;t a real problem for proving.

The argument for prover networks seems to be:

- Some ZK workloads will be run on GPUs (agree)
- GPU capacity is more evenly distributed among many compute providers than CPU capacity (agree)
- New entrants can offer competitive pricing (agree, this is largely due to AI companies overbuying GPUs)
- Marketplaces have emerged to match demand/supply for GPUs in AI (agree)
- We need ZK-specific decentralized marketplaces (disagree).

I think that one mistake is conflating (for example) SF Compute Co (SFCC) and a decentralized prover network. SFCC is building an exchange for GPU compute. The benefit is that sellers don&apos;t need to take on inventory risk because traders will buy in order to resell. MMs and SFCC take some spread and buyers get a competitive price.*

A decentralized prover network is not analogous to SFCC. SFCC is centralized and doesn&apos;t care if the entirety of the supply of compute comes from one vendor. A decentralized prover network does care, by definition, and must incentivize multiple concurrent compute providers, even if some offer higher prices to users. This adds inefficiency and cost. 

A market can still be efficient even if sellers aren&apos;t bidding on a blockchain. GPU-focused neo-clouds don&apos;t magically have absolute pricing power because they aren&apos;t on a blockchain. If the market were inefficient, you&apos;d expect to see wildly different pricing across neo-clouds, which afaict doesn&apos;t appear to be the case.

*It&apos;s unclear whether this will be viable long-term, or if it&apos;s a specific consequence of (temporary) GPU oversupply and intentional allocation to neo-clouds. We may see consolidation in the future, making an exchange unnecessary.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Yes. The long term solution is to create political structures that are more resistant to this.

I see two attractors:

1. Political leaders live in imperial palace, not allowed to have external lives -&gt; no benefit from getting a bribe
2. More distributed power, so less gain in corrupting any specific person

It should be obvious which one I prefer and am interested in working on.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Reflecting on the last few days thereâ€™s a lot of constructive dialogue thatâ€™s been occurring which is great. 

I think @fede_intern is really onto something 

We have a very good opportunity to get leaders from various aspects of Ethereum (ACD, PBS, DeFi, etcâ€¦) to come together to bring a level headed approach to what it means to steward Ethereum at the EF level or other means. 

It could be immensely beneficial to have a healthy mixture of well established businesses who contribute to the core success help in an advisory position (not compensated) to what the future board of the EF may look like. 

This obviously raises COI - but transparency is the biggest asset to help with that. Having people with expertise on weathering the storms of bear markets, growing their companies and being boots on the ground in the trenches of development can offer a unique point of view to the EF. 

Thereâ€™s a huge difference to having an open line, and being an active participant at the advisory level. I would worry seats on the board raise too many eyebrows, but having respected and level headed builders in the mix could be a net positive. 

We see whatâ€™s happening, our livelihoods are built on-top of Ethereum (and other ecosystems in some cases), and we run organizations at scale. The learnings can be immensely helpful. 

We want Ethereum to win. We want crypto to win.

I see it similar to when ACD started to make conceded efforts at listening to the app builders, bringing them into the discussion on how to improve the protocol. We have a similar opportunity to do the same here</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: There is perhaps an analogy with weed here.

Ten years ago, to many weed represented freedom, and rebellion against sclerotic old order that denied self-sovereignty over our bodies. Then, weed became legalized, and &quot;official&quot;.

On that day, I remember my personal interest in weed dropping by &gt; 2x overnight.

And since then, public discourse is moving toward a balanced view of weed: it is much less harmful than alcohol and smoking, and has valuable medical uses, but it is also far from harmless, especially in its modern corporate hyper-optimized versions.

Crypto finance is similar. In the old order, @GaryGensler created a regime where tokens that give investors clear indication of what their rights are and where their revenue comes from is a &quot;security&quot;, but obfuscated &quot;governance tokens&quot; are potentially in the clear. This was a perverse distortion of incentives, and it is a key reason why @GaryGensler must never be christened as a hero, even among crypto skeptics. Everything that happened in crypto was in part a response, part compliance part rebellion, to these pressures.

Over the last year, we have been entering a new order. Now, the most powerful people in the world are cheering on the idea of anyone creating tokens for anything, at any scale.

And so now is the time to talk about the difference between sugar-high short-term fun that is unwise to recommend to newbies, and long-term fulfillment and wealth-building. It is not about &quot;fun is bad&quot;, it is about the equivalent of modern hyperaddictive cellphone games, versus chess or World of Warcraft.

Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation states.

This is in a sense the essence of d/acc: the goal is not to indiscriminately accelerate everything, including superintelligent AI and fentanyl, the goal is to selectively accelerate defense so that it can keep up with offense. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of cultivating our own sense of virtue. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of creating better alternatives.

In defi, we are already starting to see a return toward honest token-based fundraising that gives users clear understanding of what they are buying, bringing us the best of pre-2020-era ICOs while addressing their downsides. The @infinex_app patron sale, and the @Truemarketsorg NFT sale, are two examples of this, and I personally know of other examples that are soon to come.

There is a bright future of capital allocation mechanisms that can be built. Potentially, we can come up with ways to ensure alignment with community wishes as well as safeguarding important values like privacy, security, open standards and open source, that could be part of the incentive structure itself. Acceleration is coming either way; it is our task to choose the brightest possible vector.</title>

        <title>Jump was a crucial tech, market maker and investor for many blockchains.

Its culture limited itself.

I believe we will see some new Jumpâ€™s in the year to come.</title>

        <title>Weâ€™re moving forward with Ethrex. Weâ€™re very close to the first big milestone.

We worked on fixing several issues uncovered when trying to sync with Holesky testnet, specifically on the P2P layer, but also when loading the initial state with snap sync. We&apos;re at the stage now where we&apos;ve downloaded all accounts, and are now syncing the storage.

Changelog:
-  Refactored P2P to use Codec to stream RLPx Messages.
-  Implemented engine_getPayloadBodiesByRangeV1 and engine_getPayloadBodiesByHashV1 methods.
-  Fixed discovery server crashing when decoding packets with malformed signature.
-  Added loading the node key for P2P on startup or generating a new one if it doesn&apos;t exist.
-  Added periodically showing a log of peer stats.
-  Fixed max retry logic when fetching account range.
-  Refactored only enabling full sync after a successful snap sync.
-  Fixed range validation when requesting storage ranges.

# LEVM
We focused on adding support for the Pectra upgrade, implementing almost every precompile of EIP-2537 (BLS curve operations, check the changelog below) and nearly finishing the implementation of EIP-7702 (EVM Object Format, currently fixing minor bugs). We&apos;re also wrapping up the ethrex L1 &lt;&gt; LEVM integration, with a PR switching the feature flag levm as a default feature. For the full integration, we need to conditionally pre-execute the transactions coming from the RPC with levm.

Changelog:
-  Implemented the precompiles BLS12_G1ADD, BLS12_G1MSM, BLS12_G2ADD, BLS12_G2MSM, BLS12_PAIRING_CHECK, BLS12_MAP_FP_TO_G1 of the EIP-2537.
-  Extended the EVM EF test runner to parse and run the EIP-7702 tests.</title>
