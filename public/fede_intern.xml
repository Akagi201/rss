        <title>RT by @fede_intern: I think this is correct and decoupling without trust is hard. The current favourite for a workaround for this centralising force seems to be leaning on preconfirmations with gateways, a la mev-boost relays.</title>

        <title>I like the zk shared bridge but if native goes live and you have based rollups with preconfirmations working (not difficult to do, native needs coordination) you have decentralized very fast rollups without multisigs and security council and great interops between L1 and other L2s. 

If you want ZK you only will need to prove with a RISCV zkVM an L1 client + all the addons you want and with based native rollups and preconfirmations you will have the best of both worlds.

In less than 18 months this will become the default for rollups. Infra is gonna be commoditized and at the end it will be all customer acquisition.

I’m gonna explain the technical details in another tweet.</title>

        <title>Since tech has no motto I believe this is incorrect. People are switching to deepseek, even microsoft is offering it in its cloud when chatgpt is an important investment for them, even if chatgpt has better distribution. X and Google have better distribution than chatgpt, nevertheless chatgpt has more adoption.

With RISCV zkVMs the comparison will be easier and people will switch one for another one if what you can save is relevant enough. That’s why whales use cowswap rather than uniswap. Cowswap had a better product. With a RISCV zkVm you have no differentiator apart from performance and security.

People will make money otherwise. ZK as AI LLMs have a raise to the bottom. You make money by building wrappers and things on top.</title>

        <title>Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
Hear the sound of broken chains,
See noble equality enthroned.

From the new champions their faces
Mars himself seems to inspire,
And the gleam of their weapons
Inspires great courage as well.

Come, O people, take heart!
Victory crowns us at last!
Let us swear with glory to die,
Let us swear with glory to die!</title>

        <title>I will be more clear: I believe @titanbuilderxyz is doing things correctly. I still need to study and learn more about alternatives but I like the fast engineering solution first to then complicate things.

Based rollups are going to be faster than Solana. I’m writing a thread about it in the plane.</title>

What if lenders could verify wages privately -- no predatory loans needed?
