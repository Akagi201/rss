        <title>RT by @0xstark: Excited to announce that @ralexstokes and I are moving to the position of EF Research co-leads!

With this new role, I hope to accelerate pragmatic research for Ethereum and find more ways for us to involve the ecosystem in our many exciting projects.

What is EF Research?

Starting with a single original &quot;Research team&quot; at the Ethereum Foundation @ethereumfndn, a group of 5 teams has come to be known as &quot;EF Research&quot;. Today, these 5 teams are:

- Applied Research Group (ARG): Emphasis on getting research ideas into production, data engineering (the famous dotpics! https://dotpics.info) and specifications, with a new bend towards applied cryptography

- Consensus R&amp;D: The root from which more teams appeared, focusing among (many) other things on consensus, specifications of PoS Ethereum, and protocol-driven research

- Cryptography: A team involved in delivering cutting-edge, secure cryptography for use by the protocol. See also https://crypto.ethereum.org

- Protocol Security: Wide range of expertise to keep Ethereum safe, from code reviews to advanced tooling, simulations and bug bounty programs. See also https://github.com/ethereum/protocol-security

- Robust Incentives Group (RIG): A team concerned with the mechanisms and economics powering the Ethereum protocol. See also https://rig.ethereum.org

What changes now?

- Our aim with Alex is to ensure that EFR is always at its best, internally and externally. Alex and I are starting a new team named &quot;ResearchOps&quot;, focused on supporting the incredible work done by members of EFR, and more broadly on the delivery of research for Ethereum and its community.

- I am moving away from my role as team lead of RIG. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and RIG is not done yet. To continue this work, @casparschwa is taking over as team lead, I’m excited to see where he takes the group and its members!

What&apos;s next?

For me the direction is clear: Build a world computer for all to use. This means a censorship-resistant L1 at the efficiency frontier, and scale for L2s to onboard as many economies as we can imagine. Some big ticket items are of course SSF, DAS, EL R&amp;D, FOCIL, ZK, PQ… you know the list :)

Research is part of this process, and researching in public for Ethereum and its community is close to my heart. We’ll be experimenting with different ideas, and we&apos;ll also keep our ear to the ground. My DMs are always open to chat, and feel free to AMA in the replies here.</title>

Founders @dg_goens and @js_horne met while working on Coinbase, and started working on a crypto x fashion project (remember @SAINTFAMEdao ?), before launching @zora: a social NFT app where &gt;160K creators earn from their posts.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: PSA: I joined the Ethereum Foundation Leadership Team last week.

I joined the EF Research team in mid-2017, starting by contributing to the early sharding proof-of-concept. Over the years, my focus has been on L1 R&amp;D, and that will remain my core area defense. I&apos;m also passionate about Ethereum community building and enjoy bridging core research with the broader community.

The new @ethereumfndn handle is the beginning of the EF establishing more transparent communication channels. I&apos;m excited to collaborate more closely with Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi), Josh Stark (@0xstark), and Bastian Aue, and to dedicate myself to contributing to EF Leadership. My specific remit within EF Leadership hasn&apos;t been defined yet, but as my role becomes clearer, I&apos;ll share more details about my responsibilities.

As I transition from my previous Consensus R&amp;D team lead role, the internal task handover is well underway. The new EF Research team leads, Barnabé Monnot (@barnabemonnot) and Alex Stokes (@ralexstokes), are helping with the process. For my public-facing responsibilities, Justin Traglia (@JustinTraglia) will step in as the lead maintainer of the Consensus Specifications. I&apos;m not going far! To my longtime L1 collaborators, please feel free to reach out. 🫶

A heartfelt thank you to everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem who has collaborated with me on this journey. Special thanks to Vitalik and Aya for their trust and support. And to EF Research: I love you 4844 times.

I&apos;m excited to see how EF and Ethereum will continue to grow and evolve—and I am fully committed to nurturing and cultivating Ethereum&apos;s future.

        <title>R to @0xstark: 2. @Fileverse is a decentralized alternative to gdrive, notion, and slack.

Fileverse lets you collab on docs, share files, and publish pages. Data is stored on IPFS, permissions are managed by smart contracts, and it&apos;s all open source and end-to-end encrypted.</title>

        <title>R to @0xstark: 1. @Aave is the worlds largest permissionless lending protocol.  

Before Aave, @StaniKulechov built one of the first DeFi apps in 2017 called ETHLend. Today, Aave hosts $20 billion across the ecosystem.

And yesterday was Aave&apos;s 5th bday - thank you for building on Ethereum!</title>
