        <title>RT by @paramonoww: How Gigagas Rollups Work with @rise_chain as the main study. Feel free to read my guest article below.

That&apos;s an interesting approach to scaling, but, obviously, not every app will require such speed.

This is the final series on exploring different types of rollups.</title>

        <title>How Native Rollups work, feel free to read my guest article down below.

Yes, this is one of the approaches to interop that can allow composability at the validator level.

However, we still need to solve interoperability for other rollups, which will 100% not be native.</title>

        <title>I&apos;m hiring a researcher to work closely with me on both public and private research projects. 

This role is ideal for someone who is highly self-organized, possesses excellent communication skills, and has the ability to write interesting and insightful content.  

Hard Skills: 
• Researcher first, writer second.

• 3+ published tech and product articles that are insightful and engaging, not just restructured tech docs.

• Focus on infrastructure primarily for EVM and Solana.

• Brief knowledge of the top 50 protocols in the crypto space. 

• Experience with Data Analytics is a bonus.  

Soft Skills: 
• Self-organized with a keen attention to detail, understanding that details separate good research from great research. 

• Ability to manage multiple projects in a fast-paced environment. 

• Clear and transparent communicator, which is possibly one of the most critical aspects. 

• Capable of suggesting own ideas, especially when you feel like something is not right.

Opportunities: 
• Work with me and tier-1 protocols in the blockchain space.

• Learn about and implement a research and writing pipeline.

• Remote work, if you&apos;re based in Asian time zone, it&apos;s even better, but not critical.

• Contract or full-time position; I&apos;m open to suggestions on this, but note that work never ends: manage your time wisely.  

If you&apos;re interested, please send me a DM with a brief introduction, your writings, and your resume if you have one.</title>

        <title>Hyperliquid is a pretty weird platform. I connected my wallet, bridged USDC from Arbitrum, bought HYPE on spot, and it was okay.

After two days, I went to the website, and it said my account was flagged as high risk, while on all other dapps, it was never recognized as such. 

I messaged them through email, but they didn&apos;t respond. I opened a ticket on Discord, and the guy sent me a template response. After my question, I got muted for 7 days?

I can&apos;t swap, deposit, transfer, or withdraw, so I can&apos;t do anything with the money I deposited.

The fix was using @Hypurrfun to swap HYPE for USDC and transfer from spot to perps, and then using @deBridgeFinance to bridge from Hyperliquid to L2.

Thanks to @KamBenbrik and @cp0xdotcom for helping with the issue.

I understand that even if my address was marked as high risk, why would you let me deposit on the platform but not allow me to withdraw? 

Okay, even if this happened, should I be muted for 7 days after simply asking how I can get my money back if I can&apos;t do it via your UI?</title>

        <title>Data Availability is more important than you think.

Most people view the DA Layer as temporary storage for data access by users and apps. True, but that overlooks key details: 

• why is temporary storage needed? 
• who needs this storage? 
• what kind of data needs to be stored?
• what if data is not stored correctly?
• why can&apos;t we just use Ethereum for all those purposes?

External DA solutions like @eigen_da can boost speed and throughput and lower costs while still offering strong security guarantees. Data Availability is a complex topic involving scalability, speed, economics, security, and architecture. So, why should we care?

1. Why does Data Availability matter?

The data availability problem simply asks:

&quot;How can we ensure the data needed to reconstruct the blockchain&apos;s state is accessible?&quot;

As most people already know, state is simply all the data stored on the blockchain at a given moment, which is constantly updated. That&apos;s also called liveness. Without this data, verifying transactions becomes impossible and opens the door for malicious block proposers.

Ethereum addresses this by requiring full nodes to download each block, verifying transactions by re-executing them against a local state copy. It does not work the same for rollups, obviously, because it sacrifices a lot of speed, but we still need to ensure data is available to maintain security.

But what data even is that? I referred to the state lots of times, so the data that needs to be available is &quot;state data,&quot; a.k.a. transaction history. If data is not live, you sacrifice security and risk that your rollup won&apos;t be re-org resistant.

Reorgs can occur during L1 block finalization, which means that Ethereum might split into different versions due to malicious acts.

A rollup might align with a fork instead of the canonical chain until the correct chain is settled. Moreover, users might face censorship because of the weak DA layer where their transactions won&apos;t be included.

This not only poses technical challenges like data loss but also affects the UX/UI of user-facing applications.

The Data Availability problem first refers to security rather than speed and scalability.

2. What are the benefits of using an external DA layer like EigenDA?

Many rollups use Ethereum for data availability due to its strong security. So, is there any reason to use EigenDA? Yes, there are lots of them. 

A rollup can be divided into multiple layers, including the settlement layer, DA layer, execution layer, etc. The overall idea of modular blockchain is to divide it into multiple components to maximize efficiency.

However, relying on Ethereum as a DA layer does not make much sense in cases where you&apos;re aiming not only for security but also for reducing costs. The surge of L2 solutions on Ethereum led to high competition for blockspace, making transactions costly.

By March 2024, L2s spent over $37.4 million for storing and accessing data on Ethereum. That changed after the introduction of blobs with a 99% reduction in price. Well, the price was fixed, but fees are still uncertain due to Ethereum congestion.

Rollups like @0xMantle and @megaeth_labs use EigenDA because Ethereum is not a comfortable place to achieve high throughput. That means that Ethereum rollups must compete with other L1 transactions for limited blockspace, which can increase storage costs in the process.

• Ethereum blocks can handle 768kB from blobs plus other data, reaching about 2.5 MB total. 
• With blocks every 12 seconds, this gives a bandwidth of 0.2 MB/s.
• It is pretty slow and approximately equals 9,000 TPS. 

That is the TPS not for one rollup, but for all rollups that use Ethereum as a DA Layer. And yes, that&apos;s pretty slow + there is no horizontal scaling available (compute growth is not proportional to node growth).

Moreover, rollups that use EigenDA have the autonomy to handle their own state updates, in contrast to Ethereum-based rollups, which depend on Ethereum&apos;s network for managing changes.

3. How does EigenDA fix those problems?

• As I said before, rollups like MegaETH with their 100,000+ TPS are not able to use Ethereum for DA purposes. 
• EigenDA currently has 15MB/s of write throughput. 
• That means that it can handle up to 654,000 TPS with compression.

It is pretty suitable for chains that want to onboard apps where high throughput is needed, like APIs, different backends, HFT, etc. But why is it possible?

• When a rollup&apos;s sequencer sends a block to EigenDA, the disperser (an EigenDA component) erasure codes this blob into chunks, which are basically smaller parts of the blob.

• Those chunks are sent to different storage operators, getting confirmation that they have stored the data. 

• The thing is that each unique storage operator processes their own unique set of chunks, so there are no two operators who process the same chunks. 

This approach makes it possible for horizontal scaling to exist: more operators -&gt; more chunks can be processed -&gt; higher throughput -&gt; higher TPS.

The average cost of storing 1MB of data in EigenDA is approximately $0.05 at the time of writing, which makes it pretty cheap and convenient for rollups who want to store their data and make it accessible at any given point in time.

At the beginning, I mentioned that data availability is security first. But how does EigenDA handle security in that case? 

EigenDA is an AVS on EigenLayer, which means that EigenDA has its own operator set with stake delegated to those operators to economically secure EigenDA. There are over 200 operators with more than $15 billion in stake combined. So, this system is pretty secure.

Current DA systems often merge data accessibility verification with data ordering, creating complex setups. While verifying data can be done in parallel, ordering it for consensus is slow. 

This is useful for systems managing their own data order but unnecessary for systems like EigenDA, which leverage Ethereum&apos;s existing ordering mechanisms.

EigenDA achieves greater speed and efficiency in data storage, thanks to its use of erasure coding and the KZG commitment scheme, which allows for storing only the minimal required data.

4. How does EigenDA work?

The EigenDA architecture might seem pretty complex at the beginning, but in the end, everything makes sense.

1) Rollup&apos;s sequencer sends a batch of L2 transactions in the form of a blob to the disperser.

2) Disperser divides this blob into small pieces (chunks) and creates two types of proofs: KZG commitment proof and KZG multi-reveal proofs.

3) All chunks are uniquely distributed across the EigenDA Operator Set (operators running EigenDA node software and having stake delegated to them).

4) Operators also receive the commitment proof to verify chunks against it using multi-reveal proofs.

5) Operators send signatures to the disperser that they have successfully verified the chunks.

6) Disperser aggregates received signatures, registers the blob on-chain by sending a transaction to the EigenDA Manager Contract.

7) Manager Contract checks with the Operator Registry that signatures are verified correctly.

8) Rollup sequencer sends an EigenDA blob ID to its inbox contract on Ethereum.

9) Inbox contract checks with the Manager Contract if the blob ID is indeed available.

10) If available, the blob ID is added to the inbox contract, and Ethereum’s rollup view is updated. If not, a malicious operator is slashed.

One important feature is that blobs are erasure coded at a 4.54 ratio. That means that the system provides more redundancy, which means the system can recover from more simultaneous node or storage failures without losing data.

The main reason to use erasure coding is to allow a single operator to store only one chunk, significantly reducing costs. As more operators join, individual costs drop.

5. What is the relationship between EigenDA and Ethereum consensus? Can’t rollup just use EigenDA?

Rollup can&apos;t use only EigenDA because it still needs to settle somewhere. And using EigenDA, you can only settle transactions on Ethereum. 

EigenDA does not have its own consensus mechanism; it uses Ethereum&apos;s security and validator set through restaking. This means that a rollup or an end user relies on Ethereum&apos;s consensus to ensure that data is correctly ordered and finalized.

• The rollup determines the agreed-upon sequence of transactions. 
• It then uses EigenDA for storage where transactions are posted in batches. 
• The rollup posts the state roots to Ethereum for finalization. 
• After the transactions are sequenced and recorded on the base layer, they are permanently added to the rollup chain, becoming irreversible (finalized) after a certain period.

6. If the DA layer is not secure enough, what happens?

There are two big problems a lot of teams are working on: re-org protection and censorship resistance. 

Security against censorship and reorgs requires a robust DA layer where economic security prevents majority control. The primary design concern is the cost of consensus attacks.

As the old saying goes: &quot;To minimize malicious behavior, we need to make it unprofitable.&quot; 

A blockchain is economically secure when attack costs greatly exceed potential gains. Verifying proofs on Ethereum enhances rollup security against censorship but doesn&apos;t address all issues with data availability. 

If the DA layer is compromised, the rollup remains vulnerable since Ethereum&apos;s smart contract only checks attestations. This can lead to liveness issues where new blocks can&apos;t be produced, illustrating that using one blockchain for data limits security assurances from another.

Before EigenDA, there were data availability committees which look pretty similar to dPoS. EigenDA is different because it&apos;s open for everyone who wants to run node software or delegate their assets. It also offers more security because operators can actually be slashed if acting maliciously.

7. Which apps need to access the DA network besides the rollup and Ethereum themselves?

Well, there are lots of them. DEXs, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, staking protocols, and interoperability protocols all require full transaction history for various purposes like liquidity tracking, financial calculations, authenticity verification, compliance, governance, reward calculation, and secure messaging.

@alt_layer uses EigenDA for rollups launched on their platform, @Calderaxyz lets you launch a rollup within 1 minute with EigenDA, etc. There are lots of different interesting use cases.

There has been a lot of &quot;monolithic vs. modular&quot; discussions over the past year, but in the Ethereum landscape, there has been more modular stuff winning.

Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), DA layers, different sequencing modules, finality layers: it seems like every big part of the Ethereum ecosystem is in the process of being split into multiple ones and maximizing the efficiency of each part. 

As I&apos;ve said a lot in my previous writings, the future of millions of general-purpose rollups and app-specific rollups is inevitable, so if it&apos;s inevitable, let&apos;s make it efficient.</title>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Data Availability is more important than you think.<br>
<br>
Most people view the DA Layer as temporary storage for data access by users and apps. True, but that overlooks key details: <br>
<br>
• why is temporary storage needed? <br>
• who needs this storage? <br>
• what kind of data needs to be stored?<br>
• what if data is not stored correctly?<br>
• why can't we just use Ethereum for all those purposes?<br>
<br>
External DA solutions like <a href="https://nitter.freedit.eu/eigen_da" title="EigenDA">@eigen_da</a> can boost speed and throughput and lower costs while still offering strong security guarantees. Data Availability is a complex topic involving scalability, speed, economics, security, and architecture. So, why should we care?<br>
<br>
1. Why does Data Availability matter?<br>
<br>
The data availability problem simply asks:<br>
<br>
"How can we ensure the data needed to reconstruct the blockchain's state is accessible?"<br>
<br>
As most people already know, state is simply all the data stored on the blockchain at a given moment, which is constantly updated. That's also called liveness. Without this data, verifying transactions becomes impossible and opens the door for malicious block proposers.<br>
<br>
Ethereum addresses this by requiring full nodes to download each block, verifying transactions by re-executing them against a local state copy. It does not work the same for rollups, obviously, because it sacrifices a lot of speed, but we still need to ensure data is available to maintain security.<br>
<br>
But what data even is that? I referred to the state lots of times, so the data that needs to be available is "state data," a.k.a. transaction history. If data is not live, you sacrifice security and risk that your rollup won't be re-org resistant.<br>
<br>
Reorgs can occur during L1 block finalization, which means that Ethereum might split into different versions due to malicious acts.<br>
<br>
A rollup might align with a fork instead of the canonical chain until the correct chain is settled. Moreover, users might face censorship because of the weak DA layer where their transactions won't be included.<br>
<br>
This not only poses technical challenges like data loss but also affects the UX/UI of user-facing applications.<br>
<br>
The Data Availability problem first refers to security rather than speed and scalability.<br>
<br>
2. What are the benefits of using an external DA layer like EigenDA?<br>
<br>
Many rollups use Ethereum for data availability due to its strong security. So, is there any reason to use EigenDA? Yes, there are lots of them. <br>
<br>
A rollup can be divided into multiple layers, including the settlement layer, DA layer, execution layer, etc. The overall idea of modular blockchain is to divide it into multiple components to maximize efficiency.<br>
<br>
However, relying on Ethereum as a DA layer does not make much sense in cases where you're aiming not only for security but also for reducing costs. The surge of L2 solutions on Ethereum led to high competition for blockspace, making transactions costly.<br>
<br>
By March 2024, L2s spent over $37.4 million for storing and accessing data on Ethereum. That changed after the introduction of blobs with a 99% reduction in price. Well, the price was fixed, but fees are still uncertain due to Ethereum congestion.<br>
<br>
Rollups like <a href="https://nitter.freedit.eu/0xMantle" title="Mantle Network">@0xMantle</a> and <a href="https://nitter.freedit.eu/megaeth_labs" title="MegaETH">@megaeth_labs</a> use EigenDA because Ethereum is not a comfortable place to achieve high throughput. That means that Ethereum rollups must compete with other L1 transactions for limited blockspace, which can increase storage costs in the process.<br>
<br>
• Ethereum blocks can handle 768kB from blobs plus other data, reaching about 2.5 MB total. <br>
• With blocks every 12 seconds, this gives a bandwidth of 0.2 MB/s.<br>
• It is pretty slow and approximately equals 9,000 TPS. <br>
<br>
That is the TPS not for one rollup, but for all rollups that use Ethereum as a DA Layer. And yes, that's pretty slow + there is no horizontal scaling available (compute growth is not proportional to node growth).<br>
<br>
Moreover, rollups that use EigenDA have the autonomy to handle their own state updates, in contrast to Ethereum-based rollups, which depend on Ethereum's network for managing changes.<br>
<br>
3. How does EigenDA fix those problems?<br>
<br>
• As I said before, rollups like MegaETH with their 100,000+ TPS are not able to use Ethereum for DA purposes. <br>
