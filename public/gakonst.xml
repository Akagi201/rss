        <title>RT by @gakonst: Reth v1.2 brought huge performance gains and cleaned several public types and APIs, especially requiring fewer type conversions with revm.

It wasn&apos;t perfect, as a breaking API made our custom payload service uglier, so we opened a GitHub issue. It was addressed in 2 weeks and we happily pinned the new commit downstream.

Addressing a low-priority quality-of-life issue in 2 weeks and before a new release is certainly bullish. Reth does care about our DX. Let&apos;s &quot;complain&quot; more!</title>

        <title>aren&apos;t based rollups just centralized sequencers given the proposers need to pick a gateway? decentralizing the gateway is the same as decentralizing the sequencer. something feels off to me.</title>

        <title>We must scale DA on Ethereum in 2025, or the L2s will move to other chains. 

If L2s also issue stablecoins or other RWAs directly vs via the L1, then that migration will be even easier and more painful for Ethereum.

Scale the consensus layer!</title>

        <title>L2s can always be faster than L1s because they can provide safety of user funds without losing performance via a global network of validators.

If an L2 isn&apos;t faster than an L1, it&apos;s a temporary bug.</title>

        <title>Flashblocks by Flashbots are awesome. 

250ms is a constant in the code. it could be lower bc no state root calculation overhead. the lower you go the closer to first come first serve, so you don&apos;t want it to be per tx to allow other ordering rules eg prio ordering.

Built on Reth ðŸ«¡.</title>

        <title>Holesky and other testnets exist to find issues. 

Excited that Reth &amp; Erigon worked well, and IMO NBD for other teams. Shit happens. We fix and keep shipping as one team. Highly recommend Reth in prod.

Would it have been better had no client had a bug? 
Sure. 

Was the bug easy to find? 
Yes. 

Does it mean we should go slower? 
No.</title>
