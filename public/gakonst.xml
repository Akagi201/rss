        <title>Looks like Reth is now behind Geth and Nethermind, per Ethernets!

Upcoming releases will have months of perf work enabled by default, it&apos;s time to start ramping up adoption on both staking and RPC providers on L1 &amp; L2s.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: So this is definitely researcher speaking, I don&apos;t want to annoy client devs too much with half-baked ideas. That said, I see a few dimensions in which we need to scale:

- compute (verify signatures, compute opcodes, precompiles)
- calldata (bandwidth &amp; history storage)
- state access (disk loads)
- state growth (writing to new state location / account)

I am specifically most excited about delayed execution payload verification ideas in combination with better pipelining. @fradamt has started to look into this (triggered by @_charlienoyes &amp; co), and is doing amazing work there. The intuition being to try to keep nodes busy during most of the slot, not just in bursts when a block is published.

That could in itself get you 10x for burst loads. Then you need to figure out how to solve the increased sustained loads:

- compute: slower sync
- calldata: slower sync, more history storage
- state growth: more state size

Sync is challenging but solvable. History we will start to drop and only store in a distributed way. State growth we have ideas, but still need a reliable strategy for.

There are many nuances in getting delayed verification to work. Around free DA issues (maybe pre-charge coinbase, but that would make local building harder. or charge for txs before exectuion, but that might have backwards compatibility issues). Around calldata DA checks (put calldata into blobs?). Around fork choice (no idea on that one, trusting that @fradamt will sort that out). etc.

Definitely much yet to be figured out, and not sure that any of that will work. But there are so many ways to improve execution - some of it will certainly work!

I am getting to a reasonable level of confidence that delayed verification / pipelining plus smarter pricing plus smarter ways of dealing with state will get us a long way.

Sorry, just a bit of brainstorming dump, because you asked. Probably missing 10 aspects, just whatever is top of mind rn.</title>

        <title>🚨 Action required: After &gt;3yrs of heads-down development, Foundry is en route to our first stable release! Upgrade your installation of Foundryup! 🚨

2025 is looking to be an amazing year with faster and more secure EVM smart contracts!

Foundry is a critical part of the EVM development stack, empowering developers through their end to end development lifecycle, from quick builds to deep tests and rich debugging workflows.

More importantly, for the EVM to win, Foundry must remain a reliable building block for developers. For that, we must graduate to having stable releases, so we encourage all developers to upgrade their `foundryup` installations.

Upgrading is really simple, just run: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`.

❗Why upgrade?

Upgrading ensures your `foundryup` defaults to updating to the latest stable release instead of the latest nightly build. That build is hosted on Github under the `stable` tag: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/stable.

In the coming weeks, we&apos;ll be shipping our last few breaking changes to Foundry (e.g., turning off the optimizer by default, which was recently shipped). If you do not upgrade, you will continue to receive nightly builds by default, which may contain these breaking changes.

✨ Prefer nightly builds?

You are still able to receive the latest nightly builds by running `foundryup --install nightly`

Be cautious — nightly builds may include breaking changes that are difficult to debug without context.

🔄 Switching between versions?

Easily manage your installations with: `foundryup --use &lt;version&gt;`

e.g. `foundryup --use nightly`, `foundryup --use stable`

⚙️ And the CI?

The foundry-toolchain GitHub Action will use the latest stable release unless you specify the version to be different: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain/, via the `version` tag.

Huge kudos to legends @gndizzy @zerosnacks @YashAtreya @DaniPopes who have taken over the Foundry torch in the last year.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: The future of the world computer is decentralized.

EF is only one part of the world computer.

Perhaps the org that some people want to reform and bring back to new greater heights is actually not EF, but @Consensys (or some third thing in the same category).

EF should not &quot;midcurve&quot;, it should confidently represent the aspects of Ethereum that it can be effective at representing, and deliberately create and nurture open space for other orgs to represent the other aspects of Ethereum. Some of those other aspects arguably even make more sense in a for-profit format.

EF should not "midcurve", it should confidently represent the aspects of Ethereum that it can be effective at representing, and deliberately create and nurture open space for other orgs to represent the other aspects of Ethereum.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: No. This is not how this game works.

The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a &quot;proper board&quot;, but until that happens it&apos;s me.

If you &quot;keep the pressure on&quot;, then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent. Some of Ethereum&apos;s best devs have been messaging me recently, expressing their disgust with the social media environment that people like you are creating. YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER.

And you are decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing &quot;what you want&quot;.

Milady.
