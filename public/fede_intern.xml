        <title>RT by @fede_intern: I agree with your point, at least to a certain extent. But it&apos;s entirely orthogonal to what the TAM is.

Also, it matters what the top 5% of projects do, the rest 95% will fail.

The space is rapidly changing these days.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: How big is the TAM of ZK?

I believe the TAM of ZK can be orders of magnitude larger than that of rollups.

(TAM: total addressable market)
(ZK: verifiable computation / SNARKs)

Ben mentions three limiting factors for the TAM of ZK:
(1) the need for data under provenance
(2) headwinds of advances in TEEs
(3) cost overhead of ZK (aka kappa)

While I agree with Ben&apos;s points, I believe the TAM of ZK can be orders of magnitude larger than that of rollups. Here&apos;s why:

Re data provenance: It is true we have very little data with provenance today. However, I believe that data under provenance will grow exponentially:
- We have a growing number of solutions that add provenance to existing data: &quot;zkTLS&quot; and RFC9421 adds provenance to any data served via HTTPS.
- With the prominence and progress of gen AI for images, audio, and video, there&apos;s also a growing sector that is working on attested capture devices (e.g. &quot;zk microphone&quot;, content authenticity initiative for cameras).

Re TEEs: It is true that TEEs replaces ZK at the cost of trusting the hardware design and manufacturing supply chain (moreover, there has actually been work on minimizing the trust required from the supply chain as well as amplifying cost of attacks, spearheaded by folks from the EF, Flashbots and Fabric Cryptography). Ultimately, it comes down to question of cost. I concur that if verifiability is needed at little overhead (&lt;10x), then TEEs are the best one could ask. This brings us to the final point--

Re cost overhead of ZK (kappa): I believe the TAM of ZK is large even in a world where kappa = 100.

My counterpoint is simple, the cost of raw compute is simply not the limiting factor any more, outside of a few places like AI &amp; ML (thanks to over half a century of Moore&apos;s law). Recall Amdahl&apos;s law: if the cost of raw compute is only 0.1% of the cost of a system or process, then a 100x increase of raw compute will only incur a 10% overall cost increase.

Many business processes have a cost structure where the raw cost of compute is very low, where incurring a 100x zk proving overhead is actually very reasonable, because it means removing the costs of trust elsewhere in the process (e.g. trusts on humans involved).

If you don&apos;t believe me--tell me which goods (besides raw computer parts) and services have costs going down by 2x every 2 years? I&apos;d be surprised if there are many examples here. This means that cost of goods and services are dominated by costs other than the cost of compute, because cost of compute has been decreasing exponentially for decades. (Note: AI is a prominent counter example where cost is dominated by compute.)

I believe when it comes to finding the best skeptical optimists for a technology, there&apos;s no better place to look than at the frontier of that field. Ben have been working on ZK for many years and is supervising PhD students who work on ZK. So one should take his points very seriously--

Ben&apos;s points are actually great pointers for the ZK space on how to accelerate towards the TAM: push for more data under provenance &amp; identify processes where cost of compute is already de minimis.</title>

        <title>🚀Ethrex Ethereum Client: Big Moves Incoming 

🔥Preparing for Performance Improvement
In the coming weeks, we’ll focus heavily on addressing performance issues. We’re integrating observability tools, testing proofs of concept, and refining the codebase with targeted fixes. Recent changes include:
- Resolved unlinked reorg issues.
- Implemented getPayloadV4, completing Pectra endpoint support.
- Refactored LEVM and rEVM for better separation, maintaining compatibility with both.
- Applied several CI enhancements for stability.

🌎L2
We’ve begun state diff reconstruction, using a new tool to monitor L1 blobs and reconstruct L2 state. A pull request is live to optimize L2 performance by consolidating block building and execution into a single function—eliminating redundant Engine API calls. Work has also started on the Secp256r1 precompile (RIP 7212) to enable WebAuthn-based account abstraction.

⚡️Performance: Benchmarking and Optimization
A new CI workflow now benchmarks block execution against main, providing data for our performance efforts. We’re exploring database improvements, adjusting libmdbx settings (growth_step, sync_mode) and minimizing blocking during transaction commits. Collaboration with the L1 performance team is underway to validate these changes during sync operations.

🛠️LEVM: Final Steps
We’re resolving Hive test regressions from the past week. Once complete, Ethrex will transition to using LEVM as the default configuration.</title>
