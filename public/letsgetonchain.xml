        <title>RT by @letsgetonchain: This is pretty cool just skimmed through the white paper.

Wondered how these faster than finality transfers are possible and who takes on the risk.

Coupled with hooks that @circle  now enables you can now cross chain swap USDC to any other token extremely cheaply and fast!

This is great for Ethereum&apos;s interop efforts!</title>

While not free this is probably going to be much cheaper than what you pay to market makers/solvers to upfront USDC traditionally simply because using a single globally shared allowance for all chains is more efficient than setting up capital reserves for each chain.</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 4/ 

Because fast transfers uses the protocol‚Äôs over-collateralization pool, they don&apos;t come for free and the fee depends on how much allowance is left in the pool, how risky the underlying chain‚Äôs finality is etc..</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 3/

CCTP V2 addresses this risk with a built-in global over-collateralization pool that absorbs the potential risk/loss.

This means that the global pool size limits the total value of tokens in transit that can be minted early through an internal accounting system.</title>

CCTP is a burn and mint bridge.

If Cricle mints USDC on the destination chain before the source chain reaches finality it risks ending up with unbacked USDC. A reorg would &quot;unburn&quot; the source chain USDC.</title>

Traditional cross-chain fee less transfers wait for full &quot;finality&quot; ensuring transactions can&apos;t be reversed (reorged).  For example on Ethereum, this means waiting for approx ~15 minutes.

CCTP V2 cuts this wait down to seconds!

But how?</title>

        <title>I really dig how @SOCKETProtocol made it possible to write your entire cross chain app in solidity. 

This is made possible because the off chain &quot;watcher&quot; server runs the evm.

Even though this cross chain coordination is async in nature which does not really feel natural in solidity you don&apos;t really need to think about it as an app developer cause its all implemented for you.

Advantages are pretty big imo:

1‚É£ With Foundry you get to very easily test your full stack (off chain + on chain state)

2‚É£ Since your on chain app is written in solidity no one else should write this cross coordination than the developers that wrote the on chain app. Switching to js for this with non native types, libs etc is a painful</title>

        <title>When running multiple clients, does detecting a bug in less than ~12 min (before finalization) and shutting down enough validators running the buggy client (below supermajority), prevent bugs from becoming forks that need to be resolved through social consensus and instead resolve as a simple reorg? 

Seems like the importance to monitor and identify who is wrong as well as communicating that to the right validators in less than 12 minutes in order for them to shut down is really big. How does that coordination work ? @TimBeiko @sassal0x</title>
