        <title>RT by @tonykebot: 1 MM TPS on day one – Solayer infiniSVM

What’s our goal?

To build the ultimate blockchain capable of scaling to service the entire world. This blockchain should be nearly infinitely scalable in terms of TPS and storage while operating with a single, unified state—free from state fragmentation.

How is it different from other chains ?

We aim for infinite scalability, not merely incremental improvements.
Solayer Chain will be the first to achieve 1 million TPS in production while also serving as a scaling solution for Solana.

The math for 1MM TPS

1 million TPS x 1KB per transaction = 10 Gbps, just for incoming txs excluding P2P broadcast which would end up as multiples of 10 Gbps

1 million TPS would also imply at least 2-8MM IOPS on SSD reads and writes

state db (or accounts db)? It needs to scale too

The approach

mega-leader architecture housed in colocation centers with 100Gbps ingress from Tier 1 service providers. utilizes distributed provers, each responsible for verifying a portion of the states, while collectively ensuring verification of all states. these provers earn rewards for their contributions.

rdma over Infiniband for high speed interconnect to scale out execution and storage nodes while maintaining a single state

dedicated switch to host scheduling logic

machines dedicated to tx pre-execution

Streamlining cross-chain UX

Only dApp support is required for users to interact with the Solayer Chain seamlessly, without even realizing it. Users won’t need to switch wallets, and wallets don’t even need to explicitly support Solayer.

This is because: 
1.Chain ID is not part of the transaction signature payload
2.Dapp (NOT wallets) broadcast transactions on Solana so dapps can send transactions to Solayer chain nodes 
http://3.One transaction can have multiple instructions so bridge and Solayer chain transaction authorization can be done in a single Solana tx. 

One more thing

will also support jumbo transactions, enabling larger and deeper composability for on-chain programs.</title>

        <title>RT by @tonykebot: &quot;Why do you guys do chain now? I thought you guys are restaking projects&quot; Lots of friends ask me this question when I share the paper around.

The answer is, restaking is NEVER our mission. We were,  are, and always target to make blockchain the next generation of internet: Unlimited, Fast, Cheap, and Accessible.

We started from @solana  as SVM has the best parallelization capability and adoption.  

Then we started from restaking (EndoAVS: https://solayer.org/platform/endoavs) as as we find out that stake-weighted quality of service can HELP prioritize tx. Its also a good starting point to solve the congestion issues of solana and also for us to build up the team and influence.

We also researched many solutions as well, projects like @jito_sol, @bloxroute have their good ways to tackle the solana congestion issue.

But we believe the end game is not further software optimization or competing for block space by paying more. Blockchain should be a public infra like internet: &quot;Unlimited, Fast, Cheap, and Accessible&quot;.

@jump_firedancer  reminds us of early @Cisco and we believe that believe that hardware gona be the admission ticket to the end game.

So, here we go:

- World first hardware accelerated chain
- 100+ GBPS network bandwidth
- 1M+ TPS

Testnet soon</title>

        <title>RT by @tonykebot: I quit my PhD at UC Berkeley and joined @solayer_labs as a lead engineer to build the next-gen blockchain. Line rate (100Gbps~4Tbps or 16B+ TPS) transaction ingestion and processing have been achieved internally.   

Everyone can play Minecraft, stream 8K videos, and trade at lightspeed fully on Solayer chain. To achieve this, we draw inspiration from @jump_firedancer and offload almost every component of Solana to hardware like SmartNIC and programmable switches.   

All transactions sent to Solayer Chain will first hit the scalable ingress clusters consisting of hundreds to millions of nodes for scrubbing and pre-executions based on probabilistic predictions of future states. All execution snapshots are sent to a sequencer built using Intel Tofino switches and additional FPGA to decide an optimal schedule - most transactions do not require execution at the sequencer. For the remaining conflicting transactions, our sequencer leverages the SOTA scheduling algorithm based on more fine-grained account access patterns collected from pre-execution to re-execute.   

For a simple workload, we can achieve over 16B+ TPS, and for a fully conflicting workload, we can achieve over 890K TPS. In another way of saying, for each second, we can process billions of people transferring USDC and millions of people aping the same memecoin on Raydium.

For the remaining conflicting transactions, our sequencer leverages the SOTA scheduling algorithm based on more fine-grained account access patterns collected from pre-execution to re-execute.   <br>
<br>
For a simple workload, we can achieve over 16B+ TPS, and for a fully conflicting workload, we can achieve over 890K TPS. In another way of saying, for each second, we can process billions of people transferring USDC and millions of people aping the same memecoin on Raydium.   <br>
<br>
Testnet soon.</p>

        <title>R to @tonykebot: (END/N) Let’s rethink MEV and shift the focus back to the creators — the users, the developers, and the order sources.

With Solayer Chain, we’re making this shift possible.</title>

        <title>R to @tonykebot: (4/N) Solayer chain introduces Hooks: a mechanism that automatically executes user-defined logic immediately after a transaction interacts with one or more on-chain programs.

Through a Dutch-auction-like bidding system, the most valuable Hooks are prioritized. Rewards shares between user/program owner/network. Everyone gets a fair share.</title>

        <title>R to @tonykebot: (3/N) What if we could redirect the value back into the system and create a positive incentivized cycle?

One where the value generated by users, traders, and order sources flows back to them, rewarding them for their participation, and also to bots to rewarding them for good mev.</title>

        <title>R to @tonykebot: (2/N) Currently, A large portion of the MEV profit today is funneled into validator, not benefiting the users or order sources. 🚨

This creates a negative cycle:
- Users make trades or place orders, but the opportunity they generate doesn’t go back to them.
- Validators grab MEV profits by from tips, from front-running, sandwiching, or exploiting arbitrage, but this doesn’t directly benefit the users who are creating that value nor the bots who executes the extraction.
- Network are spammed by MEV txns</title>
