        <title>RT by @KAndrewHuang: Even more important than what we shipped is who we shipped it for: Our customers.

We support more rollups than any other platform, and they’re moving onchain innovation forward.

Let’s salute all the teams who launched on Conduit in 2024.</title>

        <title>RT by @KAndrewHuang: Despite processing &gt;50% of all onchain compute across the entire EVM (that&apos;s ETH L1, Base, Arbitrum, etc - combined) ecosystem, not many ppl have heard of @ProofOfPlay yet. 

That&apos;s going to change soon. 

In the meantime, here&apos;s a primer you can forward to anyone you know who wants to get a head start. 

1. Intro to Proof of Play:

We&apos;re building infrastructure for high performance, large scale onchain applications. We believe it will eventually be faster to build applications onchain than offchain. Potentially cheaper too. 

Most onchain infrastructure is built in a vaccuum. We&apos;ve been building ours in a live setting, by powering @PirateNation - the largest fully onchain game (~100k monthly players atm, has peaked at &gt;10k concurrent players in the game and &gt;60Mgas/s). 

We&apos;re a team of 30 and half of us are former founders who built &amp; scaled apps / games / b2b SaaS &amp; infra / marketplaces / platforms. Our founder @amittm was an early contributor to Ethereum and co-created FarmVille (where the rapid scaling of the game also became a forcing function for infra innovation). Our leadership team have worked at companies like Square, Google, Disney, Riot, Stripe, etc. 

The company is backed by a16z, greenoaks and others.

2. Live applications: 

You can get a sense for the Proof of Play platform by trying out Pirate Nation. Give it a go if you haven&apos;t already.

Our platform is not currently open to external developers, though Pirate Nation&apos;s game contracts are, and we have given read-only access to the game&apos;s Editor to our community builders.

When the POP platform fully launches our goal will be to rapidly acquire market share for both games &amp; non-gaming applications by offering a battle-tested and easy-to-use infra stack set that delivers a 10x improvement on incumbent solutions. 

Building for ourselves first has been an effective forcing function to ensure the platform is scale-ready, reliable, and the developer experience is up to scratch. 

3. What&apos;s in the platform: 

There&apos;s quite a lot here and it warrants a separate, post of its own. Onchain editor, database, multichain, token mrroring, verfiable random function (VRF), app wallet, transaction sponsoring, etc &amp; more.

Between our platform and a set of carefully vetted top-tier strategic partners, we&apos;ll offer a one-stop shop to any app or game who wants to run their application partially or fully onchain, with all the upsides and none of the downsides.  

(Important to note: we are NOT building &quot;another L2&quot; though we see L1s / L2s / gaming chains as great potential partners)

4. Composable consumer:

The most exciting part of the platform is that we&apos;re leapfrogging the &apos;consumer crypto&apos; trend to enable what comes next: composable consumer. 

The platform will allow app developers to open up their app / game to their communities to co-create / mod / remix, alongside them. This unlocks massive network effects for builders and means their community could end up building something better or more engaging than they do. 

We&apos;re starting to see some of this take place within Pirate Nation already. 

At the pace which crypto &amp; AI are moving, the only real way to future-proof your application and ensure you aren&apos;t bottlenecked by your own team&apos;s shipping cycle speeds, will be to build on the POP platform. 

5. TLDR? 

Our community has said it best: onchain AWS. 

6. How do I get involved?

Play Pirate Nation, stake $PIRATE, own / collect / participate in our ecosystem. More will be shared on our approach to ecosystem design in the future.</title>
