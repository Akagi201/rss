        <title>RT by @0xTaker: The Final Boss

Deeply Intents Episode 09: (üéôÔ∏è,üéß) - featuring @katiabanina

In this episode of Deeply Intents, @katiabanina and I discuss her impressive journey from data analytics with the London Stock Exchange Group to the Final Boss at @bebop_dex.

We had a wide-ranging conversation about the current state of speculation and trading in crypto markets including pump fun, RFQs, L2s, market makers and AMMs. Later, we focus on crypto meme culture and subculture feedback loops. We finish by discussing crypto use cases and the importance of DeFi.

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: The bear market is creeping in, and we all know what happens next: investors start scrambling, memecoins slow down, and suddenly everyone is wondering how the hell they&apos;re supposed to make money.

It&apos;s the same vicious cycle every time. People panic, jump into random plays, and lose even more.

But this time, there&apos;s a real motion happening:
Trading Pok√©mon cards on @Courtyard_io is looking like the next meta. Degens are now stacking up rare collectibles that hold global value and appreciate over time. If RWAs are the future, having extremely rare cards is one of the cleanest ways in.

Memecoins were fun until they weren&apos;t. When volumes dry up, people look for something tangible.

Pok√©mon cards are an easy bridge. Nostalgia, real-world demand, and a collector base that never left. Digital ownership just makes the whole process even more seamless.

Every cycle, something replaces the noise. I think Courtyard is it.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: Gold Star Pok√©mon cards are some of the rarest and most sought-after cards in the TCG, but what makes them so special? 

I was curious, so I took a look at the history behind these cards! It all starts with shiny Pok√©mon. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®

Shiny Pok√©mon, or Pok√©mon with alternate color variations, were first introduced in 1999 on the Game Boy Color. In these early Gold and Silver days, there was less than a 0.02% chance of encountering a shiny Pok√©mon (outside of a scripted event). This made shiny Pok√©mon extremely rare and desirable. 

I personally remember encountering one for the first and only time - a blue flame Ponyta! It was a magical experience as a 10 year old.

That experience of chasing a shiny Pok√©mon expanded to the TCG briefly in Neo Revelation and Neo Destiny, and returned in the EX Team Rocket (2004) set with the gold star cards.

These new gold star cards featured shiny variations of the iconic starter Pok√©mon, Mudkip, Torchic, and Treecko. For these incredible cards, the average pull rate was roughly 1 card in every 2 booster boxes (72 packs)! 

While these rates were more favorable than encountering a shiny in-game, it still made the cards a highly desirable chase, which has only grown over time.

Subsequent sets released more of these gold star cards for popular Pok√©mon such as Charizard, Rayquaza, and Umbreon! These cards are now some of the most sought-after in the TCG.

For example, a PSA 10 Gold Star Rayquaza card is valued at upwards of $30,000!! ü§Ø ‚≠êÔ∏è

If you learned something from this post, please give it a share. I would love to do more of these types of posts if there&apos;s an interest for them!

What&apos;s your favorite gold star card? Post below!</title>

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: Now that @EthereumDenver is over, we wanted to share a quick recap of our week.

We would love to extend a massive thank you to everyone who came to our second edition of http://searcher.wtf. It wouldn‚Äôt be possible to throw such fantastic day events without your support, so if you turned up for us, we sincerely enjoyed speaking with you and hosting you. 

We‚Äôd like to thank our sponsors @initia @AcrossProtocol @TokkaLabs @SeiNetwork and media partner @therollupco again for supporting our vision of creating the best forum for solvers, traders and application developers. 

Stay tuned for the next http://searcher.wtf!</title>

        <title>R to @0xTaker: Similarities:
- Invites financialisation of posts
- Token doesn&apos;t mean much

A couple diffs I can see:
- Zora isn&apos;t a gatekeeper - market decides value / reward fn and ppl decide what to do
- Token don&apos;t mean much, unless you make use of interactivity / some attribution on Zora</title>
