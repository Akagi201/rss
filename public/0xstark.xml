        <title>RT by @0xstark: Ethereum Foundation Treasury Update

The Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) has set up a new @safe 3-of-5 multisig wallet.

The wallet address is 0x9fC3dc011b461664c835F2527fffb1169b3C213e

An op has been initiated to send 50,000 ETH there, but be patient; due to signing delays, this will take a few days to process (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6872c97c571e26c6c1dc18999fd116a67ce23cefdecf1cfcf6fb58899ba7f4d7)

The EF will use this new wallet to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. We&apos;ve made a testing tx on @aave. Stay tuned!

Also, @safe has proven safe and has a great user experience, and we will transfer more of our funds here over time!

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Some points on this:

1. The current process of upgrading Ethereum IS BROKEN.  Builders need long-term commitments to capacity, otherwise they cannot build on Ethereum. They need to know what the plan is in 5 years.
So I hope that we can finally agree to timelines in the core dev process.

2. We nonsensically claim that L1 cannot be scaled and L2s are the only way.
This is a complete ivory tower perspective -- Vitalik already posted this 3 years ago, and with DAS and zkEVMs the ingredients are now ready: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html
There are limits to this, yes, but scaling it 100-1000x in a few years is completely possible.
This achieves many things that based/native/etc. rollups don&apos;t.
I think actually doing this and stopping to find excuses for not doing it is essential for Ethereum winning.

3. Not everything can be on Ethereum L1, whether the actual limit is 1k or 100k tps or maybe even 1M tps. For this it is still great to add lots of data availability and create a great Ethereum security zones for rollups, who are Ethereum allies and can use Ether and all other Ethereum assets trustlessly.
But we need to do it at a scale that actually matters. We need to get to our current target of one Megabyte per second in 1-2 years rather than 5, and then KEEP GOING. I am currently doing research on maximally decentralizing the networking DAS/Data Availability Sampling, but until that&apos;s done, adding Data Availability Provider nodes with higher requirements is a good solution that has the same security assumptions as optimistic rollups (one honest node).
Other Data Availability protocols are currently building for GB/s! Ethereum does not have to match this, but being at 1/1000ths is not good enough.
Some projects are openly stating already that they will never use Ethereum DA (and openly advertising with Vitalik&apos;s support! The irony). Being ok with that and still claiming that they are somehow &quot;Ethereum aligned&quot; is thoroughly un-ambitious.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: There is no reason to be anything but over the moon bullish for ETH, Ethereum Layer 1 and the Metropolitan Ethereum ecosystem, from what I am seeing.  Bitcoin and Solana are and will continue to be great at what they do, and I look forward to forging deep integration with both ecosystems as Web3 evolves.  

Nothing will be able to rival the breadth and depth of the foundational Ethereum ecosystem wrt progressively rigorous decentralization, credible neutrality (so even if nation states are at war they will still be able to enter into smart contract-based deals with one another -- including treaties -- and back their word with large stake), censorship resistance, developer base, massive transaction throughput, low latency, and universal composability.  Much of this is here and more will be improving fast over the next couple of years.  

Major institutions now feel comfortable building on Ethereum, because of its size, maturity, talent base and roadmap.  Just as every company needed to migrate to the web in the 90s and 00s, the gold rush to Web3 is about to massively accelerate.  Web3 -- the re-decentralized web -- is the natural evolution of the open protocol and open spec-based internet and web.   Most traditional businesses will start to migrate to Web3 over the next few years.  And wildly creative memecoin, AI memecoin, NFT, social graph and gaming degen activity will be there -- as well as on other major platforms.  Most importantly, Metropolitan Ethereum will be the most trusted platform for DeFi.

There are multiple giant projects that I am aware of that will help anyone who is uncertain about Ethereum&apos;s powerful future to grow delirious with Bull Fever.  2025 is the year the world will move significantly on-chain. The major inflection point that we have all been waiting for is now in the rear view mirror and the paradigm shift to a progressively decentralizing world is now in full gear and will rapidly accelerate.</title>

Most traditional businesses will start to migrate to Web3 over the next few years.  And wildly creative memecoin, AI memecoin, NFT, social graph and gaming degen activity will be there -- as well as on other major platforms.  Most importantly, Metropolitan Ethereum will be the most trusted platform for DeFi.<br>
<br>
There are multiple giant projects that I am aware of that will help anyone who is uncertain about Ethereum's powerful future to grow delirious with Bull Fever.  2025 is the year the world will move significantly on-chain. The major inflection point that we have all been waiting for is now in the rear view mirror and the paradigm shift to a progressively decentralizing world is now in full gear and will rapidly accelerate.</p>]]></description>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year. Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress.

What we&apos;re trying to achieve is primarily the following goals:

* Improve level of technical expertise within EF leadership
* Improve two-way communications and ties between EF leadership and the ecosystem actors, old and new, that it is our role to support: users (individual and institutional), app devs, wallets, L2s
* Bring in fresh talent, improve execution ability and speed
* Become more actively supportive of app builders, and make sure important values and inalienable rights (esp privacy, open source, censorship resistance) are a reality for users including at the app layer
* Continue to increase our use of decentralized and privacy tech and the Ethereum chain, including for payments and treasury management

Explicit *non-goals* are:

* Execute some kind of ideological / vibez pivot from feminized wef soyboy mentality to bronze age mindset
* Start aggressively lobbying regulators and powerful political figures (esp in USA, but really anywhere, especially large powerful countries), and risking compromising Ethereum&apos;s position as a global neutral platform
* Become an arena for vested interests
* Become a highly centralized org, or even more of a &quot;main character&quot; within Ethereum

These things aren&apos;t what EF does and this isn&apos;t going to change. People seeking a different vision are welcome to start their own orgs.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Agree here. 6/9 is a good step for pectra (not long ago it wasn&apos;t even in the cards), and the focus should then fully be on peerdas asap and with as much throughput as we can convince ourselves is safe, best if increasing by the full 8x &quot;sharding factor&quot;. No low value sidequests.</title>
