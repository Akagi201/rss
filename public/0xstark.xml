        <title>RT by @0xstark: the comment section got pretty heated, so here’s my take:

there aren’t a lot of gen z people in this space because they’re mostly working on different things or just following the career paths their colleges push them toward.

a lot of them hate their jobs. a big reason is that they don’t believe their work actually matters.

most of the young talent in crypto comes from people who have gone deep down the rabbit hole to discover it for themselves. it’s not easy enough to stumble into, and that’s a problem. crypto benefits when more people see it as an industry that offers flexibility and a way to contribute on a global scale.

instead of spending millions on exclusive conferences and insider events, maybe we should invest more in making it clear that crypto is one of the only industries where talent can break in from anywhere, work from anywhere, and operate at a level that isn’t constrained by geography or traditional career pipelines.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: We have been discussing it a lot. At the moment we assume a model as follows:
* we start with full trust and parallel full mandate
* operating independently yet communicating async often and supporting each other
* supporting more regions
* taking advantage of our distinct strengths

You should be able to choose whichever Co-ED you want to communicate with based on your style and needs and any of us will have the mandate to execute on the top level. Treat it as 2 for 1 rather having to wait for both of us to communicate.

Still, the EF leadership team has slightly more collective feel than what you would expect from a CEO-led organization. Vision comes from @VitalikButerin and @AyaMiyagotchi , strategy comes from the leadership team / entire EF team, execution from myself and @hwwonx will be to serve EF and the ecosystem / communicate as much as possible and provide the best decisions when needed without delay.</title>
