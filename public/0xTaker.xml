&quot;But that&apos;s not really X&quot;

Seeing this on the timeline gets incredibly boring for which very few are actual nerdsnipes but everything else is just plain shilling

There&apos;s a lot that separates a good product from a great product, and teams that work on the latter trying to nail it day-in-day-out succeed organically from inspiring such behavioural change from their early users to the late majority</title>

@arjunnchand sits down with Peter, founder of @RelayProtocol &amp; @reservoir0x, and unpacks a story that starts with NFTs and ends with a protocol reshaping how value moves across chains.

They dive into the battle of intents vs. token standards, the challenges of scaling solvers, and why chain abstraction might just be the hardest UX problem in crypto.

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: i love base but this aint it. sadly the majority of this volume is fake :(

@SynFuturesDefi making up vast majority (90%+) of this stated volume and their volume is clearly all fake. haven&apos;t seen anyone call them out on their bs but we didn&apos;t integrate because of it

how can i tell their volume is majority fake? 

1) oi/volume. they claim 24hr BTC/USDT PERP volume of $312m but only $3m open interest - so OI/volume = 1%. for comparison binance is $9bn / $20bn -&gt; OI/volume = 45%

2) spread. despite having -1 bp maker fees their spread on BTC/USDT PERP is 10 bps (could drive a semi truck through this, as far as blue chips go). this would collapse to being tick-wide given the rebate, at 9 figure daily volume. binance&apos;s spread is a tick wide and their best fee tier on usdt-m perps is much smaller.

3) volume patterns. they&apos;re too smooth. volume arrives in fits and jumps around volatility - not in smooth sine wave patterns. zoom out on 1 hr timescale and compare to binance.

@bsx_labs is a notable exception. good platform, great UI, strong team. no bullshit metrics, honest people. criminally underutilized imo</title>

how can i tell their volume is majority fake? <br>
<br>
1) oi/volume. they claim 24hr BTC/USDT PERP volume of $312m but only $3m open interest - so OI/volume = 1%. for comparison binance is $9bn / $20bn -&gt; OI/volume = 45%<br>
<br>
2) spread. despite having -1 bp maker fees their spread on BTC/USDT PERP is 10 bps (could drive a semi truck through this, as far as blue chips go). this would collapse to being tick-wide given the rebate, at 9 figure daily volume. binance's spread is a tick wide and their best fee tier on usdt-m perps is much smaller.<br>
<br>
3) volume patterns. they're too smooth. volume arrives in fits and jumps around volatility - not in smooth sine wave patterns. zoom out on 1 hr timescale and compare to binance.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://nitter.freedit.eu/bsx_labs" title="BSX">@bsx_labs</a> is a notable exception. good platform, great UI, strong team. no bullshit metrics, honest people. criminally underutilized imo</p>
