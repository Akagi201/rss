        <title>R to @quant_arb: Citadel is still a serious player, but I don&apos;t think their track record in crypto or entering other markets hints that they are so unimaginably skilled that they&apos;ll cause some materially different impact than all these other tradfi shops joining/ that have joined.</title>

        <title>To elaborate on this. The latter half of the book is in fact so awful that it is massively -EV to read early on in your career without the knowledge that it is junk.

Quantum algorithms, random microstructure literature, HPC???</title>

        <title>Just started prompting ChatGPT for some advanced knowledge on Pandas until I found something interesting.

Honestly discovered a TON of cool features in pandas I would have had no idea existed. 

Try it.</title>

        <title>For those interested in why:

1) MACD vs BP is not a very useful question in the first place

2) lot of random stuff thrown in there (jumps, correlations, triple barrier) which sounds cool but has no relevance / information value

3) super basic research question when you remove the random shit thrown in there which should take &lt;1h to answer

4) 24h is far too short a sample period &amp; doesn’t cover multiple regimes.

5) the performance difference is slight so given #4 it’s barely significant 

6) OHLCV data. Like come on. This is hft and you couldn’t be bothered to pay a couple hundred for a Tardis API or apply for orderbook data from binance. You choose to use Binance OHLCV data???

I can’t believe he published this</title>
