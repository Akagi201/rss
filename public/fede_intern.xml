        <title>RT by @fede_intern: This enables us all to go bankless.

Currently when you get your monthly salary it goes into your bank account so you can use your debit card.  The bank gets the yield.

Now your money can go straight into DeFi or staking and you earn the yield up until you need to spend with your debit card and just what is necessary is drawn from your onchain account.

Less bank, or you be your own bank.

Will be supercool when someone? launches a payroll system fully onchain to close this loop tighter.</title>

        <title>Today in Barcelona with @fran_aligned we saw how a group of french people got stolen at 3 PM by a french person.

Now at 23:27 we had to help a woman go from the metro station to her house because a guy was following her.

I thought people exaggerated but Europe is having a concrete measurable problem.</title>

        <title>It’s Friday. Day of Ethrex updates.

We were testing Pectra and the client in general through various devnets and testnets, with a focus on possible Pectra issues. We fixed a few of them. We&apos;re now working on improving performance and general resilience of the client.

Changelog:
- Moved the mempool and all it&apos;s logic from storage to blockchain crate
- Fixed an issue when calculating excess blob gas that was surfaced in pectra-devnet-6
- We were able to successfully both snap and full sync in pectra-devnet-6
- Fixed an issue when doing full sync and being less than 128 blocks from the tip
- Fixed an issue with storing large receipts on libmdbx that was surfaced when full syncing holesky
- Re-added an assertoor check that validates that we&apos;re propagating transactions through the p2p network correctly

L2
We added Pico as another prover backend for the L2; we only need to fix a few minor issues to get the PR merged. We also made a few minor improvements to the L1 as a whole: L2 rich accounts used for testing are now L1 rich accounts that deposit to the L2 on startup (so now all funds on the L2 correspond to funds locked on the L1 contract) and the L2 config is now done through a structured .toml file.

We also merged the Portal PR, which is the first step towards the L2 becoming based, for now forwarding requests to a gateway; the next step is to build a gateway integrated with ethrex.

Changelog:
- Engine API methods and eth_sendRawTransaction are now relayed to a gateway, falling back to their default handler if the gateway fails.
- The CLI has a new command to calculated the address corresponding to a private key.
- RPC handlers now return an error instead of panicking if body parsing fails.
- L2 Rich accounts now correspond to L1 rich accounts that make a deposit.

LEVM
We are tackling the necessary work to fully transition ethrex to levm; we made a PR to decouple all of its code from revm dependencies and will now work on fixing EF test regressions that happened last week. Then we should be ready to make levm the default, at least on everything that does not involve the prover, where a bit more work is needed to do the switch.

Perf
We made a small PR to avoid recomputing transactions sender&apos;s address when building blocks, which speeds things up by around 10%; this mostly affects the L2, since the L1 pretty much never builds payloads. We also played around with switching the mempool from a Mutex&lt;HashMap&gt; to a lockless concurrent hashmap, but we saw no significant improvement so it got discarded for now.

We also added one more load tests one that involves pure I/O (writing to a lot of contract storage slots) and ran the numbers for all the different load tests; we also ran the numbers for the node syncing in Holesky.

Our focus is now on improving our database access code, which is a big bottleneck on execution (mdbx msync takes around 22% of execution time, measured by executing 1000 blocks filled with simple fibonacci transactions).</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: &quot;I am going rogue

The original promise of cryptocurrency was simple: decentralization, ownership by the people, and freedom from centralized control. Crypto was born to remove the middleman, and to give power back to individuals. Yet, today, the crypto landscape looks far different from that vision.

Over time, some insiders hijacked the technology. They took control and undermined what was supposed to be decentralized; choosing short-term profits over the core mission. The ecosystem is now overrun with projects launched by the same investors, recycling the same technology without meaningful innovation. This vicious cycle of self-serving agendas and empty wins is suffocating the very spirit of crypto.&quot;

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: here is a short tl;dr on centralized sequencers vs preconf gateways (for based rollups)

preconf gateways definitely resemble centralized sequencers but offer a better alternative for L2s imo

latency wise, both are fast—promises in milliseconds, settlement within the lookahead for preconfs

from a decentralization perspective, both have temporary write locks, but the key difference is who grants them this right

letting L1 proposers elect sequencers is more credibility neutral than a permissioned set—like if a gateway censors, proposers can just delegate to another one

this also helps with composability—for L2s to synchronously compose, they need to be sequenced together. letting the L1 choose who handles this is more practical than requiring L2s to agree on a mutual party

on MEV, permissioned systems can restrict malicious extraction, while permissionless can’t, requiring preconf transactions to include a tip to compensate for lost MEV

long term, i don’t think this will be a big issue since most value will likely be captured by apps anyway, potentially even redistributed to users for a competitive advantage

overall the progress on preconfs has been solid, but there’s still a lot to figure out, in the first revisions, it likely won’t be a permissionless system

for @taikoxyz, the path looks like: total anarchy (today) -&gt; permissioned sequencing -&gt; rotating sequencers -&gt; L1 elected sequencers</title>

        <title>I’ve been saying for months that in the L2 world there is an agenda being pushed about good engineering practices that is not true. We can do better.</title>

        <title>As somebody building in @ethereum I agree with @0xMert_ here.

Some of the games played on the L2 are not correct. Jesse is not the responsible here.</title>
