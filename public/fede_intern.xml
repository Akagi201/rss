@Bybit_Official lost ~$1.5bn by signing a compromised tx on their safe (more details to be determined).

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: The professor becoming the student â€“ I have loved sitting in on @danbonehâ€™s Stanford graduate course in cryptography. But not for the reasons you may think.

Not only is Boneh the founder of the Science of Blockchain Conference, but he also invented many interesting cryptographic primitives. The B in BLS signature scheme, used in Ethereum, stands for Boneh.

This is the first time in decades I myself have taken a class on a regular basis. As I audit the course, my intent is not just to learn individual facts, like which cryptographic scheme is good and which is bad.

I want to learn how cryptographers think.

As I hear Boneh discuss the history of the space and effortlessly answer studentsâ€™ questions, I can get a glimpse into his brain. What does he find important? What stories does he believe to be relevant?

This experience is going to improve my work tremendously.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: David Tse is a legendary professor: as close to a rock star as an information theory professor can get. He has made fundamental contributions in so many fields. 

I have wondered why? 

One reason is because he is an extraordinary learner *with a goal*. He fixes a worthy goal and then he will learn and figure out whatever is needed to solve the problem. 

When working on wireless he had to go learn random matrix theory and he did it.

When working on power systems he had to go learn about electric grids and he went and did it. 

When working on genomics he had to go learn biology and he did it.

When working on blockchains he had to go learn branching random walks and he did it. 

Now he is learning how cryptographers think to figure out how to make Bitcoin more programmable! I wouldnâ€™t bet against him :)

It has been a privilege to watch and learn from him as a postdoctoral student, and later as a collaborator.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Our goal has always been to deliver the best possible experience for the Linea community. Weâ€™ve actively been gathering community feedback to ensure a successful Linea launch for the project and our community members.

While we initially targeted a launch in Q1, technical and design work, including with our community, is on-going. We think that it is in the best long-term interest of the Linea project and its community to get this right, so while we understand frustration around delays, our priority is to set Linea up for massive success over a timeframe of years and decades. Doing a great job on the TGE will complement the great job the technical team has done to make Linea the best-in-class zkEVM technology.

Our commitment to you is to have continued transparent communications related to this as we finalize details. We will share some really exciting updates very soon as we approach the final stages.</title>
