        <title>RT by @0xstark: epic sequencing call #17!

Many founders, including 10 rollup founders, shared their support for based and/or native rollups. Below are some their quotes. 1h45min YouTube recording coming ASAP :)

Part 1‚Äîbased and native rollups

Ben Jones from @Optimism: &quot;Let&apos;s get this right. Optimism is willing to support based sequencing and native execution. It&apos;s wartime.&quot;

Nick Johnson from @ensdomains: &quot;You can count Namechain as based-pilled and native-pilled [...] and consider us fully onboard.&quot;

Jesse Pollak from @base: &quot;We need to scale and connect the Ethereum ecosystem and based sequencing and native execution feel like the tools to do it.&quot;

Tomasz Stanczak from @NethermindEth: &quot;Based and native rollups feel super aligned, they are what we&apos;re super excited about.&quot; &quot;We will be experimenting with Surge, based rollups, and FABRIC.&quot;

Hayden Adams from @unichain: [couldn&apos;t make it; see recording for my Unichain take]

Steven Goldfeder from @arbitrum: &quot;Diversity makes Ethereum unique [...] We need to find a common core - which is a native rollup, but not stifle innovation on top of it. [...] We&apos;re excited to contribute to this direction [...] All of us want Ethereum to win.&quot;

Fede Carrone from @class_lambda: &quot;Based? For me, it clicked within seconds&quot;

Ye Zhang from @Scroll_ZKP: &quot;Based sequencing is an important way to stay in the same economic zone with Ethereum. [...] Native rollups are a super interesting idea!&quot;

Part 2‚ÄîFABRIC: Fabric to Accelerate Based Rollup Infrastructure and Connectivity

Drew Van der Werff from @Commit_Boost: &quot;FABRIC is a shelling point to coordinate and stitch together some of the fragmentation that has emerged&quot;

mteam from @Spire_Labs: &quot;Spire is devoting developer resources to native rollups.&quot; &quot;We believe that a unified set of standards based rollups will lead to greater efficiency in development timelines, bring down costs for users, and establish a compatibility zone which is why we‚Äôre excited to announce our support of Fabric&quot;

Daniel Wang from @taikoxyz: &quot;we&apos;ve been waiting for the FABRIC standards so we can work together and provide a full solution&quot; &quot;Taiko is willing to contribute to the Fabric project to make sure we can divide and conquer the problems&quot;

Amir Forouzani from @puffer_finance: &quot;Based rollups were a no-brainer for us, [...] so were native rollups.&quot; &quot;FABRIC just makes so much sense, [...] these standardization efforts are so important&quot;

Demi Brener from @OpenZeppelin: &quot;We see based rollups as a promising path towards scaling Ethereum and billions of user.&quot; &quot;We are supportive of the FABRIC efforts and are willing to contribute.&quot;

Sam Batternally from @rise_chain: &quot;I am here to voice my support for FABRIC&quot; &quot;the signaling from Ethereum that this is the direction scaling is going which will be huge to pull off and attract more builders&quot;

Vitalik Buterin: &quot;our community thrives on open source, open research [...] It&apos;s amazing to see all of this interest and willingness to work together on sequencing and interoperability</title>
