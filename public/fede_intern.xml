        <title>if you‚Äôre young these are my recommendations. this is what I wished I knew when I was younger.

master the foundations
learn english. if you‚Äôre an english native speaker, learn spanish, mandarin or arabic.

learn mathematics:
- study linear algebra and calculus with gilbert strang, and probability with william feller.
- dive into mathematics: its content, methods, and meaning by kolmogorov and all the math you missed by garrity to explore the breadth of mathematical power.
- watch 3blue1brown‚Äôs videos to visualize complex concepts.

learn physics:
- start with the feynman lectures on physics and coursera courses.
- if you‚Äôre curious, check out books from editorial mir of the soviet union, which were some of my favorites growing up.

develop technical skills
- learn linux internals: work through linux from scratch or experiment with gentoo, void, or arch linux to understand operating systems deeply.
- code in c and assembly: build foundational projects like a virtual machine, a compiler, a small operating system, or an http server.
- master algorithms: practice regularly on platforms like leetcode and exercism to sharpen your problem-solving skills.
- explore machine learning: start with andrew ng‚Äôs coursera courses, then move on to http://fast.ai for a hands-on approach to modern ai.

expand your worldview
- read philosophy: start with popper, russell, nietzsche, taleb, and marcus aurelius. these thinkers offer profound insights into logic, ethics, skepticism, and resilience.
- learn history: gain perspective by reading eric hobsbawm, yuval noah harari, and peter frankopan. their works offer deep and nuanced views of global history.
- understand finance and economics:
- watch the online courses of robert shiller and perry mehrling to understand how money and markets work
- read the financial times.

care for your body and mind
- train your body: run (use the c25k subreddit as a guide) and practice calisthenics (bodyweight fitness subreddit). mind and body are one; in modern western society, we often forget this connection.
- eat well: avoid sugar. focus on a diet rich in meat and vegetables for sustained energy and health.
- avoid excessive usage of drugs and alcohol.

cultivate essential life skills
- improve social skills: go on dates, many of them. focus not on sex, but on learning how to be entertaining and how to listen. if you can‚Äôt connect with others, you won‚Äôt be able to lead or persuade effectively.
- be patient: mastery takes time, usually one to two decades. embrace failure as part of the process.
- help others: support your family, friends, and community. whether through religion, education, or mentorship, find a way to give back. for me, helping others in education and supporting other founders has been deeply rewarding.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Nah, you brought up &quot;possible&quot; vs. &quot;economically rational&quot; and got two examples of why the former is mostly meaningless. If anything, you distorting your lack of understanding to this semantics was the strawman.

Regarding your &quot;idea&quot;, you made a bold claim about (Mega&apos;s) centralized sequencer&apos;s speed constraint and suggested beefing based infrastructure up to that scale without even knowing the cost of running one (lol). 

That is worse than napkin research and yet you claim &quot;dead serious&quot;. Maybe people would take all of us more seriously if you did more as @fede_intern suggested.</title>

        <title>The funny thing is that as a believer ik Ethereum and it‚Äôs L2 roadmap I agree more with @aeyakovenko than @jessepollak.

You can‚Äôt escape Pareto. Almost everything will happen in one L2 and there will be only a few major smart contracts: stablecoins, swaps, NFTs,  It seems @base is that L2.

I don‚Äôt see how believing there are more smart contracts makes you more close to Ethereum philosophy that focuses on decentralization and robustness.</title>
