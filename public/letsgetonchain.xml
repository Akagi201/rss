        <title>Reading up on this weekend&apos;s drama..

Solana&apos;s current fees have never given me reason to be bullish. Their business model is not sustainable. Anything should be valued on projected earnings. If you think squeezing billions out of retail every month is sustainable than yes you can use the current fees to forecast future earnings i guess..

The only reason I ever got interested in blockchain tech are its permissionless, trustless, and credibly neutral characteristics (whether for SoV use like Bitcoin or compute like Ethereum) that make it likely to be globally adopted. Solana has always felt to me like a semi-centralized run infra developed by a very centralised company. I personally never saw value in that eventhough I am sure that the top engineers at Solana push the boundaries of what that semi centralized infra is able to do. But the point is that you either go all in on the characteristics above or you do none of it. Instead of going of halfway might as well run a single node blockchain and still promise people to permissionlessly deploy their memecoins there.

Things I‚Äôve never really seen (maybe my timeline is an echo chamber‚Äîlet me know who to follow to change that):

- Forums, twitter threads where the equivalent of EIPs get passionately discussed in Solana land by brilliant people worldwide
- Energetic open source activity on clients / tooling etc like we see in evm land (like Foundry, Ape, etc. ).
- The kind of grassroots dev activity I see in replies on accounts like @optimizoor or @gakonst. Some reports say Solana dev activity is massive, but I‚Äôm only seeing meme coin launches, not 0-to-1 primitives.

Happy to get corrected by @0xMert_ @aeyakovenko or anyone else who can point me to the right people to follow to change my perspective. I want to see that wider, community-driven engagement at the infra and app layer, not just in-house ‚Äú10x engineering‚Äù work to get excited about anything in Solana land to believe it has a credible path to acquire the characteristics mentioned above over time.</title>

I covered each of these with a video where I go through every line of code in the evm that changes!

Did a video for every EIP in Pectra that directly affects the EVM. For each EIP: 

- I discuss its overall purpose 
- delve into every line of code that‚Äôs modified in the EVM implementation

Playlist link üîó in second tweet!

It&apos;s obvious apps can offer better products to users by ordering their transaction in a specific way, for example @Uniswap can design that ordering to benefit LPs and swappers.

        <title>Who‚Äôs going to tell @haydenzadams  zero-latency interop is live, thanks to token locks? üòè
@SOCKETProtocol

It feels to me chain abstraction endgame with zero latency UX will:

-&gt;  use native interop within ecostystem (OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit) 

-&gt; use token lock based protocols across ecosystems.

For &quot;across ecosystem&quot; are there other interop solutions that offer zero latency without additional fees?

Enjoyed the episode @TrustlessState @BanklessHQ !</title>

        <title>RT by @letsgetonchain: Seeing a lot of confusion between account abstraction and chain abstraction. Both are a subset of a broader push to improve blockchain UX. 

I define chain abstraction as an effort to make interactions independent of the underlying network from a UX perspective while preserving properties such as trustlessness and permissionlessness.

Nice to see those different demos visually!</title>

History shows retail often doesn‚Äôt care about decentralization, until they do. Short term, they prioritize UX.

The concept of &quot;One Ethereum&quot; via chain abstraction offers both.

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 11/ Back to our example of depositing into aave on base or swapping cross chain, all the user has to do is to sign a single UserOp which gets instantly executed!

How? The solver can execute it immediately on destination chain. The paymaster can then claim it back form the CAB risk free.</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 10/ With Socket‚Äôs framework of account abstraction (CAB), the user sees one chain-abstracted balance and never deals with separate chain allocations.

Under the hood the user has a 4337 smart wallet with CAB locking functionality deployed on every chain!</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 9/ In our example imagine a user wants to deposit 1000 USDC into @aave on @base or swap 1000 USDC for OP tokens on @Optimism.

Bad news: under the hood, he has 300 USDC on @ethereum, 300 USDC on @arbitrum and 400 USDC on @zksync.

Good news: He doesn&apos;t even know any of it.</title>
