        <title>this is not that surprising. from my very deep knowledge I know that some firms use “fill-or-kill” orders when trading. if their orders don’t get filled the firm will force them to kill someone. look it up it’s 100% true.</title>

        <title>R to @quantymacro: real talk I learned a lot about things that are not necessarily “new”, but more about using pre-existing stuffs in a more conscientious way to fit better models, combining forecasts, evaluating signals etc. 

also a lot of other new stuffs actually.

10/10 no notes</title>

        <title>today I had the fortune of going through banks’ papers/articles and see how they run regressions to create their rates “fair value model”

        <title>the multiplication table 12 has always been hard for me. for the life of me I can’t memorise it. I only can memorise up until 12x5=60. if I wanna calculate 12x8, I have to do 12x5 + 12 + 12 + 12=96 in my head to get the answer. 

I’m a quant btw</title>
