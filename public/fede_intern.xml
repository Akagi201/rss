        <title>We all want crypto to be a place for business people and talent to grow.

The problem is that the real companies are between 20/30 and there are too many grifters. Even between those 20/30 many are competitors but they know itâ€™s bad to have so many people lying so much. Not sustainable long term.</title>

        <title>Fights are always bad. The problem is that sometimes they are needed.

Everyone complains about why people donâ€™t speak up before problems hit the fan. Well from time to time people do speak up.</title>

        <title>Rushi @rushimanche you have enough problems going on. 

We just got calls from exchanges because your tweet is publicly saying weâ€™re stealing investors.

We did everything we could to solve this privately and amicably. Itâ€™s too big.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: IT WORKS!!!!!

A FULL multiplayer with Python websockets server that receives and broadcasts all player positions every 100ms (10 times per second)

All code written almost 100% by AI with Cursor and Grok 3 wrote the server code

Now you can fly around with everyone else :D It&apos;ll probably crash after this tweet but let&apos;s try!

http://fly.pieter.com

The reason before it didn&apos;t move was it was stale players that already quit and it kept their positions

Every red plane is someone real flying now too! ðŸ˜Š</title>

        <title>Thanks Oak. Just to be clear, and if you check the things we have said publicly, this wasn&apos;t a technical criticism to a project. I have and had big criticism to our own company, to friend&apos;s companies (the brothers of @HerodotusDev for example) or to partners. This was something else.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: we have been working in many things today.

didnâ€™t had time to put together a more formal public text replying to some of the accusations.

tomorrow we will share something not only answering this but also giving updates on what we are doing and whatâ€™s next for @alignedlayer.

@fede_intern always said he will step down from a full time position once the project delivered mainnet.

he is still involved and we constantly talked about tech, strategy and gtm trying to do whatâ€™s best for @alignedlayer 

thank you to everyone that gave your support today we really appreciate it.</title>

        <title>A few years ago we found a big security bug in a protocol just before their launch.

We called the team and they completely discarded it. We told them that if they didn&apos;t fix it we would have to hack their testnet to protect users.

We called investors so that they could speak with the founder. Some investors supported us, some others started doing something that I believe was wrong: they supported the founder since they believed that in that way they were protecting their investment.

I believe at the end many of the problems that exists in crypto are related with incentive and investors that are incapable of understanding long term outcomes.</title>

        <title>We had a call with @rushimanche.

He asked me what we wanted and what we would do. I told Rushi that he can criticize our tech and our business decisions but what we won&apos;t accept is anyone saying we stole money or scammed other businesses. 

He told us that he would delete the tweet and publicly acknowledge that we didn&apos;t rug investors, because we didn&apos;t. 

We told him that independently of what he does we will legally notify him for saying we stole money from third parties and escalate the matters if necessary. He is an adult and he can do whatever he wants.

We&apos;re fine with any criticism unless somebody accuses us of breaking the law when we didn&apos;t.</title>
