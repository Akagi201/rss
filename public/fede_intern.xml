        <title>RT by @fede_intern: When I joined Mina as a founding engineer before the 2017 bull market, zero-knowledge proofs were esoteric‚Äîalmost mythical tech. It‚Äôs been an honor to help pioneer recursive ZK proofs in production, creating crypto‚Äôs first succinct blockchain. Mina is more than tech: It&apos;s been my professional home for over seven years.

I spent the first five years starting every explanation with: ‚ÄúHere&apos;s what a zk-SNARK is.‚Äù Today, watching ZK become mainstream is surreal‚Äîand rewarding. I‚Äôve worn hats as an engineer, mentor, architect, CTO, and now CEO, each role deepening my belief in the power of this technology.

Change always brings uncertainty‚Äîand today‚Äôs announcement from @MinaFoundation about o1Labs reassuming ownership of the technical roadmap for Mina might raise questions. I want to hear from you if you have concerns, my DMs are open. Transitions can be challenging, but this change is necessary for the growth of the Mina ecosystem through the decentralization of its governance and the empowerment of its community. I want to thank @evanashapiro for founding Mina and bringing us so far along this journey, @khem for his leadership over the Foundation, and for the Foundation&apos;s confidence in us to resume our stewardship of Mina as we build for the future.

At o1Labs, our commitment remains the same: open-source everything, be transparent, and build tools that solve real problems. Our vision is to create an internet where developers use programmable cryptography to build more powerful applications, and the Mina Protocol is core to that vision. With the Mina Foundation‚Äôs move to decentralized governance, we‚Äôre stepping up our role in guiding the protocol‚Äôs tech development, alongside you‚Äîthe Mina community.

This moment is also an opportunity to reset and clarify the Mina Ecosystem&apos;s vision. The internet today is powerful yet fundamentally broken: surveillance capitalism, compromised data ownership, eroded trust, and manipulation plague us. Programmable cryptography, like HTTPS and digital signatures before it, can transform this landscape.

To be clear: Mina Protocol isn‚Äôt an application framework or smart contract platform, despite what you may have heard previously‚Äîit‚Äôs the world&apos;s best zk settlement layer. This efficient, collaborative handling of zero-knowledge proofs forms a core piece of programmable cryptography infrastructure. Around it, o1Labs, the Mina community, and others are building toward an ecosystem stack across data, execution, interop, and query layers to enable sophisticated apps built with Mina, not just on Mina. It‚Äôs the composition of all of these components together that make up the Mina Ecosystem stack. We will follow up with a longer explanation of what this means to us soon.

Decentralizing the governance of the ecosystem empowers the Mina community like never before. Community-driven governance is the heartbeat of a truly decentralized public good. I‚Äôm energized by this evolution and eager to lead o1Labs through this next chapter of Mina‚Äôs story.
ZK tech will redefine what‚Äôs possible‚ÄîI&apos;ve never been more sure of this. Together, we&apos;ve built something extraordinary. Now, together, we can drive Mina‚Äôs future forward. The best days of Mina and the broader ZK and programmable cryptography ecosystem are ahead. Let‚Äôs make it happen, openly and collaboratively.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: We agree with @MinaFoundation that the best approach for the ecosystem is for o1Labs to take ownership of the technical roadmap for the @MinaProtocol. We are deeply committed to supporting the Mina ecosystem and realizing the vision of a truly decentralized, open-source internet powered by programmable cryptography.

As the ones who incubated Mina, o1Labs is proud to lead the technological stewardship of the Mina Protocol. Our focus is on enhancing core infrastructure, building foundational zk tech, and collaborating closely and openly with all community contributors. Over the coming weeks, we‚Äôll share more about our renewed vision for the ecosystem, and how we will drive the development of the protocol forward.

These changes are good for the Mina ecosystem, but we know that change can feel unsettling. To the Mina community: we&apos;re with you through this transition. We believe deeply in the power of decentralized governance, and we‚Äôre dedicated to ensuring a smooth, transparent shift that centers around you, the founders, the builders, and the believers, that make up the Mina community.

Together, we‚Äôre not just building a protocol; we‚Äôre enabling a community and an ecosystem to reshape the internet itself.</title>

        <title>I tend to agree but I think there are some projects doing well in the engineering sense or at least improving in comparison to the academic projects. I&apos;ve been and still iI am a strong critic of many things of @SuccinctLabs SP1 but it&apos;s one of the easiest provers to run if not the easiest one. It has good UX and whenever we asked for a change they improved things very fast.

@0xLita was pretty easy to use too. With @RiscZero we had quite a few issues many times with @MauroAligned but it&apos;s improving.

Hopefully we can all improve this. One of the reasons @Optimism is doing so well is because it&apos;s super easy to launch a chain with their stack. It&apos;s very difficult to do so with other L2s.

With Ethrex we&apos;re trying to commoditize everything for anybody to be able to launch a based zk L2 in Ethereum.</title>
