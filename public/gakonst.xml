        <title>RT by @gakonst: ðŸ¤– New EIP: XXXX

By: 
- Charlie Noyes
 -Dan Robinson
 -Justin Drake
 -Toni WahrstÃ¤tter

ðŸ”— https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9241

This EIP proposes delaying the ExecutionPayload&apos;s state root reference by one block, so that for each block `n`, the `state_root` in block `n`&apos;s `ExecutionPayload` references the post-state of block `n-1`. This change aims to remove the expensive state root computation from the block-propagation critical path, reducing end-to-end latency for block production and potentially increasing throughput. It simplifies the block production pipeline, accelerates real-time ZK proving, and is a consensus-breaking change requiring a coordinated hard fork.</title>

        <title>Cross posting my 7702 answers from Warpcast to here because Tony from the Farcaster team asks good questions!

- not necessarily, you can forget the key and just replay the auth sig across chains, delegate to proxy and use the contract to handle upgrades. alternatively can store the privkey in cloud etc encrypted w enclave, nbd imho.
- unclear it matters, the ui will give you a preview over x-origin iframe, and your contract will have enough safety checks to ensure you don&apos;t get rugged. check secure payment confirmation web api if you really care about doing it non blind. 
- granted but not deal breaker, your contract can have multiple signers, need to be thoughtful about it but navigable, plus passkeys being pushed top down.
- session keys app/account interface is important to get right, see our work in porto for more: https://www.ithaca.xyz/updates/porto, and our WIP session key api which is still evolving: https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto/tree/next?tab=readme-ov-file#keys
- zkemail is fantastic imo and totally underutilized. next up figuring out how to get google&apos;s certs reliably on chain as a public good, so we can do jwt verification for oauth.
- timelock or otherwise optional. can easily make your account say &quot;if an operation tries to transfer more than X value of such asset, request more auth keys (mfa) and also queue it up for 1mo in the future to ensure user can abort op if hacked from master key&quot;

we have put multiple examples on how to use 7702 and have deployed it on Odyssey, our devnet with Pectra + EOF, see below: 

https://github.com/ithacaxyz/odyssey-examples

There&apos;s also many examples / demos across Twitter if you search &quot;7702&quot;, see eg this one using &quot;anvil --odyssey&quot; which enables the same features Odyssey has but on Anvil (soon Anvil will be running same code as Reth via Reth SDK!)

https://x.com/thegaram33/status/1877410275814445170

There&apos;s more going on but this should be a good start for people! 

I cannot wait to show the world what full force crypto is, the stack is finally here and we&apos;re gonna lead the charge with our years of experience building the best open source tools.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: Yup, 7702 is necessary for withdraw/pull flows which cannot be implemented into solving flows without risk (user would have to trust solver infra). It also enables solving intents for contracts that don&apos;t have a &apos;address onBehalfOf&apos;-like parameter in their functions.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: We&apos;re open-sourcing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for Llama 3.3 70B and Llama 3.1 8B! These are, to the best of our knowledge, the first open-source SAEs for models at this scale and capability level.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: 1/ The early net was characterized by competing frameworks w/ hardcoded apps. Then came TCP/IP &amp; the modern web.

Early AI had neural nets with predetermined tasks. Then we got generalized LLMs.

Early ZK was app-specific circuits and rollups. Then came SP1 &amp; Provable Software.</title>
