        <title>RT by @gakonst: The future of the world computer is decentralized.

EF is only one part of the world computer.

Perhaps the org that some people want to reform and bring back to new greater heights is actually not EF, but @Consensys (or some third thing in the same category).

EF should not &quot;midcurve&quot;, it should confidently represent the aspects of Ethereum that it can be effective at representing, and deliberately create and nurture open space for other orgs to represent the other aspects of Ethereum. Some of those other aspects arguably even make more sense in a for-profit format.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: No. This is not how this game works.

The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a &quot;proper board&quot;, but until that happens it&apos;s me.

If you &quot;keep the pressure on&quot;, then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent. Some of Ethereum&apos;s best devs have been messaging me recently, expressing their disgust with the social media environment that people like you are creating. YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER.

And you are decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing &quot;what you want&quot;.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: Just to fill you in: I left the EF last year due to health issues and in an attempt to clear my head after working my ass off exclusively at the EF and on Ethereum for seven years.

I stepped aside, and the EF and the broader Ethereum ecosystem moved on without missing a beat—new leaders stepped up, and the machine kept running.

I got the much needed time to reflect without being so close to the gears of the machine. In my reflections, I got excited about the EF potentially entering a new era, not a full departure from prior strategy and philosophy, but an evolution to meet the world as it is today and as it has greatly changed over the past decade.

I opened a dialogue with Vitalik and others at the EF about such changes and the possibility of being involved in this new era. These discussions started long before this past week and are ongoing.

I’m grateful for the overwhelming support I’ve received from Twitter and many longtime friends and colleagues. However, some of the discourse has turned counterproductive. These are real people attempting to sort through and do what is best. With or without me, the EF is evolving and for the better. You’ve been heard, but vitriol is ultimately harmful to this process.

I believe in a community that fights its battles with respect and reason. So, fight for what you believe in, but please take the high road.</title>
