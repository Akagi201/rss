        <title>RT by @fede_intern: This is a good take. Ethereum doesn’t need a milady culture, or go get rid of femboy, soybean whatever, it just needs to understand its users and want to win more than anything else. And be absolutely relentless about it.</title>

Roughly $98B is tokenized into stablecoins

Not bad for a system that didnt exist 10 years ago. Eventually, most global debt will settle on ethereum</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Don&apos;t fret, brother. 

Crypto is, and has always been, 99% nonsense grifty garbage/scams/jokes, and 1% fundamental global financial system revolution.

But this 99/1 is based just on quantity of projects.

Considered by market cap, it&apos;s more like 75% quality, 25% nonsense. Bitcoin is good. Ethereum is good. Stablecoins are good. Several dozen defi projects are good. Wildly cool technology permeates through all of it, and sound economics underpins its long term growth, though the short term feels often like an appallingly irrational market. 

How to cope with this dichotomy? 

Embrace the degen frontier and have fun, and recognize that amidst it all, a decentralized financial system is real, is important, and is working. None of it is forced on anyone, after all. 

We are building and we are attracting the world toward us... and much of the world simply wants to gamble and have fun. This is okay, and actually provides capital for the important work happening behind the casino. 

It is, actually, working. 

We are realizing the wildest dreams of those who are into it for all the right reasons, despite the accompanying fantasies of those who aren&apos;t.

Just keep building, and build well.</title>

        <title>Miden is an amazing piece of tech. Bobbin is one of the founders we have worked in our history. Highly recommend you follow him. He is not doing a copy cat L2. He is pushing what is possible in Ethereum. Privacy, scaling, client side proving.

I honestly believe there is no more advanced design in the L2 world.</title>

I go to conferences, try products, code smart contracts. If you&apos;re just trying things of the competitors it means we&apos;re very late. We need to change course.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Some takeaways from my fundraising journey in the past weeks:
Some VCs focus on one thing—the token event and short-term liquidity.
Others understand that we’re building a trust layer for the internet, where bringing people on-chain isn’t just a metric—it’s an asset in itself.
Self-sovereign identity and decentralized registries aren’t about speculation. They solve real inefficiencies in governance, commerce, and digital ownership.
The projects that prioritize real-world adoption over short-term cycles will define the next era of Web3.
I know which side we are on.</title>
