        <title>1inch market maker @trustedvolumes got hacked for over $4.5M and a few smaller MMs got hacked for $0.5M yesterday. 

The root cause is that 1inch calls MM contract‚Äôs resolveOrders function to get funds to its settlement contract. Most bots only checked the msg.sender = settlement contract  - and unfortunately there was an arbitrary call vulnerability in settlement contract. Thus the hacker could forge resolveOrders call and drain MM contracts. 

The funny thing is the hacker incorrectly transferred half of the stolen funds to the 1inch settlement contract, making the funds available for everyone to grab, and he spent quite sometime to get funds back. We were trying to compete but the hacker got it first unfortunately.</title>

        <title>MegaETH is a fork of Reth v1.0.5, running with op_reth and EigenDA. The only apparent modifications to Reth they are running are adjustments to certain RPC methods to accommodate mini-blocks and putting the entire database into memory (`--data-dir /tmp/`?) based on publicly available logs and metrics.
 
Seeing how two Reth nodes can be down for over 3 hours is quite surprising imho, especially for a team that has raised $30M+. And the issue turns out to be simply OOM üëâüëà But anyway, I respect MegaETH founder&apos;s work.</title>

        <title>RT by @shoucccc: We @shoucccc @tonykebot found a critical vulnerability in http://time.fun last week and conducted a hack. The vulnerability allows hackers to steal all trading fees and modify metadata (e.g. change &quot;toly&apos;s minute&quot; to &quot;vitalik&apos;s minute&quot;) of every tokens launched. 

As the issue has been resolved, here is the full disclosure:

http://time.fun provides each new user with a dedicated wallet to deposit USDC for trading. User&apos;s private key is securely stored in a third party provider. But SOL is needed to cover gas fees and http://time.fun wants a seamless interaction for users, the wallet ‚ÄúHW2C...Lo1H‚Äù signs every trade transaction alongside the user‚Äôs wallet signature. Surprisingly, this same wallet also owns all tokens launched by http://time.fun. As it is one of the signers, we can act on behalf of ‚ÄúHW2C...Lo1H‚Äù if we can let the backend sign arbitrary data.

We discovered that by forging a token, it was possible to trick the backend into believing it was signing a legitimate transaction‚Äîletting us change metadata or withdraw all funds from ‚ÄúHW2C...Lo1H.‚Äù We reached out to the team (through buying 1 minute of their founder on http://time.fun) meanwhile did a whitehat hack. The team responded and fixed quickly and we returned all the funds.

All backends should never sign transactions coming from the frontend, regardless of how thorough the validation or simulation checks appear. These safeguards can be bypassed by obfuscating transactions or bundling/front-running transactions to alter their semantics.</title>

        <title>R to @shoucccc: It seems the tx is leaked via auction feed (https://docs.48.club/puissant-builder/auction-transaction-feed). Last time, there was a public debate over MEV Blocker&apos;s similar endpoint, and generally, folks believed this could facilitate blind sandwiches. 

Thanks @longteac @seaify1 for the info.</title>

        <title>Turns out @cz_binance sent the first $TST buy tx to private RPC, but that tx still got leaked somehow. 

CZ&apos;s buy tx (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x84fba4557a3062ecfba9135cd75e95222a28dc24051f48fc9a4b750f1b24843e) set the minimum output to 363,225 TST, while at that block, he can receive up to 365,564 TST (~0.7% slippage). If this tx is not sent to the private RPC, then it can lead to a $200+ profit for the sandwich bot, and the sandwich bot must sandwich it. However, none did and the block builder payment was much lower than $200 at that block, so it is apparent that CZ used private RPC. 

The reason that CZ&apos;s buy tx failed was due to someone buying TST ahead of CZ (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x9b2b3b99536bbe167e84f7852c5617b41a0096e9676bc68876f78772b555364f). Unfortunately, this guy got sandwiched. Block builder prioritized this tx with sandwich txs over CZ&apos;s tx because the sandwich bot made $0.2 payments to block builder. If CZ set his gas price to 1.5gwei, his tx would likely be prioritized and succeed. 

The real suspicious thing is why would 0xB2d57876271eA8684e7c521c1265b87703d9A0DA (B1) know CZ is buying $TST in advance. The bot explicitly checked CZ&apos;s TST balance (if it succeeds) and attempted to backrun his transaction. Is the private orderflow shared with this bot? Maybe I am retarded and missed something, or I guess only the bot owner/block builder/relay knows.</title>

        <title>RT by @shoucccc: what happened with @Bybit_Official  just now?

1. hacker somehow constructed a tx to upgrade a bybit  wallet code to a malicious version. 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x46deef0f52e3a983b67abf4714448a41dd7ffd6d32d32da69d62081c68ad7882

2. hacker did a 90 USDT test tx to address under control

3. 1 minute later, the hacker transferred 400k ETH to the same hacker address

4. as well as 800mETH, 90k stETH, and 15k cmETH

5. the hacker quickly distributes assets into different addresses, trying to escape
