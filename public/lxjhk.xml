        <title>some thoughts: SIMD-0096 is going to reduce the amount of tips going through Jito 

because it’s better to directly pay higher priority fees and not have to consider whether a Jito or non-Jito validator would be the leader. 

jito’s push for the tip router is to ensure there is still a way to take percentage cuts by standardizing block reward distribution.

jito offers two other benefits:

- bundles: this is gonna be unaffected for as long as jito validator adoption remains high
- anti-ddos: one overlooked aspect of Jito is that they operate a centralized transaction scrubbing center, allowing active validators to receive higher-quality transaction streams directly. This benefits validators in the form of more transactions included and higher block rewards. However, with the decreasing demand limiting their ability to take as large a percentage cut, a better monetization method may be needed.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: reading a deepseek paper and stumbled upon a very beautiful formula where they unify SFT and MOST RL TYPES (DPO, PPO, GRPO, etc.) into ONE FORMULA*

*that requires additional reward functions to be defined.

But the fundamental insight - that all these training methods can be framed as gradient ascent on observed logprobs - is beautiful.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: thoughts on whether tools need to build a brand:

started playing around with @mpcvault recently, which I had never heard of until my team found it as an alternative to our current MultiSig solution (which is actually pretty expensive). 

now that i&apos;m trying @mpcvault : super smooth app, offers both EVM and Solana support, and has a feature article in TechCrunch from a few months ago https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/mpcvaults-crypto-wallet-for-businesses-hits-500m-aum-in-7-months/

super low engagement on CT, I don&apos;t know what their cofounders&apos; Twitter accounts are and don&apos;t know what they are yapping about. 

but the product is great, and tons of businesses are using it as a part of its operating toolkit, evidently. 

how important is it that a product like this becomes a household name, that the founders of a product like this starts creating personal brands through though leadership content? 

they don&apos;t need Yap scores, tens of thousands of followers or community members to build a great product as a tool, but it does mean that when we needed a MutliSig, they&apos;re not our first choice, because I literally didn&apos;t know about it. 

I wrote a thread when I was still leading Growth at @orca_so that made the case for community being unimportant for certain products (https://x.com/KayZizzle/status/1674607730307530752), but in the last six months I have slowly moved away from that idea. 

I wish MPCVault spent a bit more time focusing on brand, I wish its twitter account had videos that showcased how the product worked, or case studies from other builders like me. 

I wish I could get a sense of the feelings their product would give me (seamless, secure, dependable) before I laid my hand on it. 

because I would have used it much much sooner. 

brand building is slow, and hard to get right.

but I&apos;ve never been more convinced that it&apos;s worth investing in.</title>
