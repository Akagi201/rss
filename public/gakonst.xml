        <title>RT by @gakonst: It doesn’t cost $10 million to launch a rollup.

But more importantly, you’re thinking about rollup costs all wrong.

Study Nvidia. Study Jensen Huang.

        <title>RT by @gakonst: Memecoins were once fun and pure, but the industrialized trenches have turned a harmless PvP game into a predatory one, dominated by insider edge.

Traditional casino games and memecoins share a core design idea: a high “return to player” (RTP) that masks a built-in edge while delivering intermittent, variable rewards to players.

Traditional casino games like slots and blackjack offer high RTPs (90-99%+), meaning you might lose $1-10 in expectation on $100 of wagers. These games work because they leverage near-miss effects and the gambler’s fallacy, ensuring that the lure of a big win (variable payoff) keeps you in the game even as you’re bleeding bankroll.

As I see it, the main issue with memecoins-as-gambling-game today is that they have moved away from their purest form to a fully industrialized version of the trenches. Initially, they functioned more like a PvP slot machine: most bets evaporate, but there’s a small chance to graduate with a 5-25x+ multiplier, or even hit a jackpot-level payout of 100-1000x+ when they temporarily become PvE. The thrill is from “catching a runner” or watching someone hit a massive win.

Now, only 1-1.5% of PumpFun launches graduate every day. I would guess nearly all of these are industrialized, operated by sophisticated insiders and influencers (“eca”) like [REDACTED] who launch them to their audiences with ever shortening half-lifes. All of this lowers the effective RTP for casuals, transforming memecoins from a pseudo-random high RTP slot-style game to a predatory, low RTP insider game where casual users are set up to lose.

The death knell for these games is when RTP drops so low that uninformed players have ~no chance to profit. Gambler’s fallacy and social media can temporarily keep the game alive by spotlighting winners. Over time, if nearly all profits are captured by house edge, the player pool is liable to dry up and destroys the original, harmless PvP thrills that made memes fun in the first place.</title>

        <title>A fresh idea on scaling from our own @notnotstorm. 

Increasing the gas target from 50% to 75% could be a great way to bump throughput without reducing worst case load.

Note there&apos;s precedent on this for blobs in Pectra, so it could be a quick win.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: a coin isn’t the only way to capture value and create something valuable onchain.

non-predatory options for ye:

+ release collectible tracks and earn royalties when traded
+ tokenize ownership of his upcoming album and reward owners with exclusive perks like access to shows and merch
+ allow other artists to remix his track and earn splits when they monetize it
+  permissionlessly sync licensing 
+ and all the unintended value add that comes with enabling other people to build experiences on top of his tokens

he can deepen his relationship with his perpetually dying fanbase and bypass the ruthless gatekeepers and exploitative middle men of the music industry.

it’s not only an additional revenue stream, but one that’s completely executed by code, lowering the overhead and human capital needed to manage and enforce agreements.

this is the future of music.</title>
