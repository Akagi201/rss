        <title>The biggest impact of this change is allowing Ethereum to increase the block gas limit by N times while it can limit block size so bandwidth is not affected by the gas limit increase.

Kudos to @monad_xyz their docs were the first time I read about the delayed state root idea (which evolved into delaying execution).</title>

        <title>Serbian tides are changing for the better, last weeks we have seen the biggest protests in the history of Serbia.

It started all with the fall of the &quot;reconstructed&quot; railroad station in Novi Sad. Where corruption and shady deals killed 15 people. It was a last straw for the people 

The driving force of these protests are students that fight for better tomorrow for future without fear of the rulling party. The last time when students have risen (5 oct. 2000), the dictator fell.</title>

Additionaly, we could introduce a partial refund on the access list item that was already warmed.</title>

I feel that we are already going there, and the teams last year were amazing. Still, testing, DevOps, and security needs to be considered essential and receive even more focus and support.

        <title>R to @rakitadragan: Protocol evolution and decision making right now are very chaotic, you need to follow discord, live chats, forums, EIPs, github PRs and tweets to figure out what needs to be added. And it is not clear how this happens.

The technical board of 20 (or 50 people) should be responsible for decisions, and it would be good to have a fail safe veto mechanism of ~3-5 people (Vitalik for example, among others)

Transparency in the process will bring stability.

        <title>My (not strong) take on what the Ethereum Foundation should focus on in the next 5 years (as only critiquing is not constructive):

* A robust funds distribution mechanism/group to fund projects and teams. The budget is done yearly and funded by basefee (unused basefee continues to be burned).
* Protocol governance where a technical board makes decisions.
* Protocol verification aka testing suites, benchmark suites, pen tests, fuzzing and infra should be the main focus of EF.

        <title>RT by @rakitadragan: Defining hardware requirements for Ethereum entities is important because it parametrizes what we mean by decentralization, enables informed decision making about protocol upgrades and allows for meaningful benchmark comparisons.

We have been gathering feedback on the current recommendations for validators:

- $1,000 total spend
- 8 cores/16 threads CPU
- 4TB SSD
- 32GB RAM minimum

Less powerful machines work today, but these specs would guide protocol changes related to validators.</title>

        <title>RT by @rakitadragan: Revm feels like going through Ethereum&apos;s history..

For example it&apos;s support for older transaction types lets you trace the evolution of fork-specific validations⬇️

Way more effective and sticky than reading EIPs.

Obviously implementing them is even better..
