        <title>Iâ€™m in a barbershop in Buenos Aires with @rj_aligned and @fran_aligned and a guy is saying that there are safaris in Ukraine where rich people can go and kill everyone for some money. I canâ€™t contain it, I started laughing too much in front of the guy.</title>

        <title>The biggest competitor Ethereum can have isnâ€™t Solana but OP_CAT being added to Bitcoin.

With ZK and L2s, Bitcoin value proposition becomes a direct competitor to Ethereum since with ZK verification and intents you can build most of the things Ethereum has.</title>

        <title>Fully agree with @musalbas.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are in the expensive/revenue category.

All the others we should try to be ridiculous cheap to onboard as many people as possible using our products to then find ways of monetizing it in 5 to 10 years. Maybe in 10-15 years.</title>

        <title>With the @KakarotZkEvm team we found a bottleneck in how Cairo Native operates dictionaries.

We benchmarked Cairo VM and Cairo Native before and after optimizing dictionary operations. For benchmarks we used an Ethereum Foundation test.

Here are the execution times for each case:
Cairo VM: 778.1 seconds
Cairo Native before optimizations: 934.1 seconds
Cairo Native after optimizations: 1 second

This means that, with these optimizations, Cairo Native runs this EF test 778 times faster than Cairo VM.

These are the PRs that implement the optimizations mentioned: #962 #963 #964.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: As a recovering ex academic, this rings true. 
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
For-profit academic publishing companies suck the value out from government grants. 

But there is something far more pernicious going on. 
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
The academic system doesnâ€™t run on money. Instead it runs on status. 
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Status is a zero-sum object (I realized this thanks to @naval tweets): if someone funds 100 Nobel prizes in an area there will be super Nobel which only one person can get. 

Academic status games suffer from many problems: (1) zero-sum nature, (2) non-transferability of status, (3) non-fungibility of status (you cannot move across areas easily). 

This leads to a certain type of players dominating: those that can play win-win-lose games where academics setup quid-pro-quo deals (you nominate me for an award and I will recommend your student as a professor), where the loser is merit. 

This makes it is really hard for many people to operate inside this ecosystem. Most importantly, those that really value curiosity, donâ€™t want to setup dark quiz pro quo and are not luckily in a field which has suddenly discovered something that has immediate value. 

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
So what might a capitalist version of academia look like?

It should reward novelty, divergence, discovery of things that have no immediate value but eventually play a role in building something useful.

We need a better system of attribution of value, ie, a better system of  karma, where all the previous moves are recorded (need crypto and blockchain for it). And a better system where the value is divided across all the different past players, like a retroactive Q function (using ai). 

We look forward to crypto and AI play a huge role in setting this up well. We will be building some foundation infrastructure that can enable these type of applications over at @eigenlayer.</title>
