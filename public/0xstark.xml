        <title>RT by @0xstark: 以太坊的机构市场营销与产品团队 @Etherealize_io 正式亮相！这一团队得到了以太坊基金会（EF）以及包括 @VitalikButerin 在内的社区成员的大力支持。

@0xstark 表示，以太坊已经在诸多实践中经受住了考验，现在已完全具备迎接机构采用的条件。此刻正是像 @Etherealize_io 这样的团队扩大金融业务发展的最佳时机。

Etherealize 团队敏锐地发现了以太坊生态中的这一市场空白，并积极行动起来。以太坊基金会始终期待并支持那些能够洞察问题并为推动以太坊发展和生态扩展付诸行动的团队。</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: There is perhaps an analogy with weed here.

Ten years ago, to many weed represented freedom, and rebellion against sclerotic old order that denied self-sovereignty over our bodies. Then, weed became legalized, and &quot;official&quot;.

On that day, I remember my personal interest in weed dropping by &gt; 2x overnight.

And since then, public discourse is moving toward a balanced view of weed: it is much less harmful than alcohol and smoking, and has valuable medical uses, but it is also far from harmless, especially in its modern corporate hyper-optimized versions.

Crypto finance is similar. In the old order, @GaryGensler created a regime where tokens that give investors clear indication of what their rights are and where their revenue comes from is a &quot;security&quot;, but obfuscated &quot;governance tokens&quot; are potentially in the clear. This was a perverse distortion of incentives, and it is a key reason why @GaryGensler must never be christened as a hero, even among crypto skeptics. Everything that happened in crypto was in part a response, part compliance part rebellion, to these pressures.

Over the last year, we have been entering a new order. Now, the most powerful people in the world are cheering on the idea of anyone creating tokens for anything, at any scale.

And so now is the time to talk about the difference between sugar-high short-term fun that is unwise to recommend to newbies, and long-term fulfillment and wealth-building. It is not about &quot;fun is bad&quot;, it is about the equivalent of modern hyperaddictive cellphone games, versus chess or World of Warcraft.

Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation states.

This is in a sense the essence of d/acc: the goal is not to indiscriminately accelerate everything, including superintelligent AI and fentanyl, the goal is to selectively accelerate defense so that it can keep up with offense. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of cultivating our own sense of virtue. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of creating better alternatives.

In defi, we are already starting to see a return toward honest token-based fundraising that gives users clear understanding of what they are buying, bringing us the best of pre-2020-era ICOs while addressing their downsides. The @infinex_app patron sale, and the @Truemarketsorg NFT sale, are two examples of this, and I personally know of other examples that are soon to come.

There is a bright future of capital allocation mechanisms that can be built. Potentially, we can come up with ways to ensure alignment with community wishes as well as safeguarding important values like privacy, security, open standards and open source, that could be part of the incentive structure itself. Acceleration is coming either way; it is our task to choose the brightest possible vector.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: A lot of folks seem unsure exactly what the 5th circuit Tornado Cash news today actually is. It&apos;s good news though not the end of the story: a publication of the November opinion and mandate, remand to the district court for remedies. This should foreclose the possibility of en banc review by Circuit (which is good). Gov&apos;t could still appeal to Supreme Court although that might be unlikely at this point. District Court will still need to decide whether the remedy is nationwide vacatur (anyone in US can use immutable contracts) or more limited relief (plaintiffs can use contracts and other parties may need to bring their own suits). Nationwide vacatur is what we should be rooting for.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: One of the first Ethereum meetups I attended was @koeppelmann presenting an overview of the DAO hack  a few days after it happened. At the time it was the single craziest thing in crypto I had ever seen and I was obsessed with following it on Reddit</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: This is a great example for a very real protocol responsibility that actually doesn&apos;t lie with &quot;the EF&quot; or even with core devs.
