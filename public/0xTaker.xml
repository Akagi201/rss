        <title>If you were to make an electronic marketplace for authentic physical goods, what would you use?

Current stack I’m envisioning from the bottom up:
- Physical products warehoused with custody provider(s) for physical valuables
- RWA token issued to manage inventory levels and transfers; physical redemption / delivery is done when the owner has signed off on it and redeemed it on-chain with necessary info off-chain.
- Sales / transfers recorded on a rollup / appchain as a public ledger (e.g @conduitxyz @Calderaxyz)
- Sales are done in a single USD-denominated currency for ease in payment and price-action resistance; a balance may be accrued digitally in the payment token to track earnings and amortise CC fees (e.g @circle @Tether_to)
- Top-ups and checkouts happen via a credit card, wire or token swap that should be 1-step seamless (e.g @daimo_eth, @zkp2p, @OneBalance_io)
- Accounts and ownership are yours and yours only - only when you have signed off on e.g redeeming an item, will balance changes occur; refunds do not rewrite history but overlay on top of a previous transaction (e.g @privy_io @get_para)
- Transactions will most likely be sequencer-sponsored to alleviate thinking about gas.
- Listing and trading of items can be done via smart contracts (Etherdelta-style even) that achieve the intended exchange
- Each feature can be a new smart contract that builds upon the RWA and payment token e.g P2P many-to-many offers
- Prompting of permissions are handled by the wallet provider or by sessions (cc @ithacaxyz @gakonst).
- Anyone can index transactions and transfers for whatever functionalities they want to achieve: vendor bookkeeping, creating price checkers, investing strategies, history of ownership etc.
- Frontends can be built by merely just tapping into the public RPC or your own indexer.

Main consideration is to reach UX parity as much as possible with traditional websites (there shouldn&apos;t even be a need to mention the word &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;gas&quot;).

Would you make any changes? Any tech that you would use specifically?</title>

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: The vision of rpcX is to improve the conversation quality between client and server.

The client is the interviewer and the server is the guest. 

A well-designed API request means the interviewer can ask sharp, specific questions, and a well-designed API response means the guest can return accurate and specific responses

The Solana JSON RPC spec fails on both counts. The question to the server is vague, and the server can only respond with slop due to the lack of specificity.

rpcX solves the read layer problem by allowing the client to ask good questions and the server to provide good answers.

When UI clients ask for account data, they don&apos;t care about the encoded byte schema. They want application-specific data rendered to the screen.

When an Explorer asks for a transaction signature, it doesn&apos;t want encoded base58. It wants human-readable context for interpreting the on-chain state transition.

A programmable read-layer enables fluid client-server communication. 

It&apos;s up to the developer to figure out the details: call/response vs pub-sub, server-side vs. client-side data filtering, and network bandwidth management. rpcX provides the tools to have fine-grained control over this non-trivial tradeoff space.

The result? 

Highly responsive, lightweight applications that can power the future of on-chain finance.</title>
