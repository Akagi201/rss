        <title>R to @fede_intern: Something else I forgot to mention is: if we&apos;re gonna go the route of having rollups, we need to make sure that users can easily move assets between them. This is more a social coordination problem than a technical one. If our design involves having more moving parts, we need to better coordinate between the different actors.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Native rollups: #NoMultisigs
—————————
This is a slam dunk idea by @drakefjustin to extend Zk proof verification from L1 to rollups using native verification. 

This extends L1 security to any rollup without having to depend on random multisigs. 

The core business model of a L1 is sell security and earn fees. This native rollup model expands the security offering solving a real pain point in rollups today. Furthermore this requires ethereum DA to be used.  

This means ethereum earns more fees and ETH grows in value.

This model is forward-compatible with existing L2s, creating a pathway to migrate to higher security. 

This model still allows rollups to have super fast sequencing and soft confirmation in addition to getting eventual strong security.</title>

        <title>If I had more power in Ethereum I would be calling urgently every big fucking L2 (@base @arbitrum  @Optimism @0xPolygon @Starknet @zksync @Scroll_ZKP @LineaBuild @taikoxyz @fuel_network, etc), every big DeFi application (@Uniswap, @CoWSwap, @aave, @MakerDAO, @LidoFinance, @ether_fi, @MorphoLabs, @ethena_labs, @CurveFinance, probably @circle and @Tether_to too), every big wallet (@safe, @Rabby_io, @rainbowdotme) and big infrastracture projects and people like (@Consensys, @eigenlayer, @flashbots_x, @LayerZero_Core, @NethermindEth, @class_lambda) and core L1 execution and consensus clients to fly to New York and to have a meeting.

Only with the CEOs or CTO of these companies and the @ethereum to talk for a week on how the hell we get out of this. With less than 30 people than can call the shots you can easily solve this if you have some war time leaders in place. If decisions are made, changes can be done in 6 months with results before end of the year.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Surprisingly, my plan would medium term decrease requirements for running nodes.

The tradeoffs are around:
 - adding dependencies for more resourceful parties (DAS provider nodes, zk provers), but with an honest minority assumption
 - giving up on home block building (which should be mitigated by FOCIL etc.)</title>

        <title>First time I read such a clear and strong message from leadership. I agree with everything, Dankrad. However, the most important thing is that we’re finally reacting to competition and criticism. Ethereum needs a strong change in how it’s being developed. We need a faster feedback loop and more ambition. We need to fight back against Luddites.

My take on the subject:
1. Gas limit should be doubled every two years at least. Computers get double as fast every two years. By increasing the gas limit as much as average computation power, verifiability of the blockchain shouldn’t have an impact.
2. We need to increase the gas limit now by a considerable amount to compensate for the amount of time it wasn’t increased.
3. As a person who has been working on L2s and ZK for years and now in the L1, I strongly believe that L1 scaling should be prioritized over L2s. If Ethereum doesn’t win, its extensions have no chance.

Blockchains are verifiable computers for making specific types of commitments. Ethereum is the most decentralized and truth machine in existence.

Supporting running an execution and consensus client on a Raspberry Pi doesn’t make the machine more verifiable. ZK + DAS + light clients do.

We need to prove Ethereum can be verified even on smaller devices than Raspberry Pis. This doesn’t mean we need to run the verifiable computer there.

Ethereum’s success depends on ETH price. We need to improve the computation power of Ethereum to be able to support new applications. If we don’t remove the Luddite meme, ETH price will continue going down against its competitors, and rollups will decide to settle somewhere else. 

Blockchains are permissionless markets in addition to verifiable computers. If the price action of the main economic asset in this market doesn&apos;t show good signs, the market in itself will not be a good place to do business independently of decentralization and technical ability. We have a lot of smart people in Argentina. Nobody wanted to do business with us until recently.

Why would I do business in a place where I can&apos;t project over the 5 years? The only people doing money and business in Ethereum are the people who already made it. That&apos;s why other new lands are more interesting for newcomers.

We need a change in tech but more importantly in culture.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Some points on this:

1. The current process of upgrading Ethereum IS BROKEN.  Builders need long-term commitments to capacity, otherwise they cannot build on Ethereum. They need to know what the plan is in 5 years.
So I hope that we can finally agree to timelines in the core dev process.

2. We nonsensically claim that L1 cannot be scaled and L2s are the only way.
This is a complete ivory tower perspective -- Vitalik already posted this 3 years ago, and with DAS and zkEVMs the ingredients are now ready: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html
There are limits to this, yes, but scaling it 100-1000x in a few years is completely possible.
This achieves many things that based/native/etc. rollups don&apos;t.
I think actually doing this and stopping to find excuses for not doing it is essential for Ethereum winning.

3. Not everything can be on Ethereum L1, whether the actual limit is 1k or 100k tps or maybe even 1M tps. For this it is still great to add lots of data availability and create a great Ethereum security zones for rollups, who are Ethereum allies and can use Ether and all other Ethereum assets trustlessly.
But we need to do it at a scale that actually matters. We need to get to our current target of one Megabyte per second in 1-2 years rather than 5, and then KEEP GOING. I am currently doing research on maximally decentralizing the networking DAS/Data Availability Sampling, but until that&apos;s done, adding Data Availability Provider nodes with higher requirements is a good solution that has the same security assumptions as optimistic rollups (one honest node).
Other Data Availability protocols are currently building for GB/s! Ethereum does not have to match this, but being at 1/1000ths is not good enough.
Some projects are openly stating already that they will never use Ethereum DA (and openly advertising with Vitalik&apos;s support! The irony). Being ok with that and still claiming that they are somehow &quot;Ethereum aligned&quot; is thoroughly un-ambitious.</title>

        <title>Our Elixir consensus client has been online for the last week in Sepolia without any problem. We&apos;re gonna test Holesky next but we need to solve a few performance bugs.

The codebase is 20k lines of code. I want to reduce it to 15k.

If you can give it a star in github.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: The problem is not how much ETH the EF sells per year. Every interaction I had with people in the EF was very good. Most of the people working there are honest and hard working people accepting a pay cut in comparison to the options they would have working in the industry.

The EF could sell everything, and it wouldn’t have a huge price impact if it did the sell in a timed manner. I’m sure the EF could be run in a more efficient way, but this is not the main problem. You’re talking about the EF as if it were the government of a country when it’s not. The problem Ethereum has is a bigger one, and the EF is only partially responsible for it. The problem exists at the social layer, and it’s a cultural problem.

The problems aren’t the EF’s but problems across the whole ecosystem. These problems have been around for years, but now they are becoming crystal clear due to the fact that, for the first time, there are two clear competitors: Solana and Celestia. If Bitcoin adds OP_CAT, it will also be a strong competitor.

I believe the problems can be summarized as:
1. No clear leadership leading the way. Too many things are being done in parallel, and there isn’t leadership saying no to most of them. People believe I’m doing 20 things, but in reality, I’m working sequentially on only one and I make sure all the things I’m doing are connected. This means saying no to 99% of the things that get proposed to me.

2. Most of the people running the show don’t even tweet. If you don’t communicate with the public, how do you expect to lead in this century? Communication and leadership are the same thing nowadays. Long blog posts are not going to replace debates in the public arena with competitors. I love blog posts and research posts but we need to explain and defend our roadmap publicly where the users are. The competitors are cheaper and faster than us. How do you explain to the common user why we&apos;re better? I believe our design is better but we need to explain why.

3. Lack of urgency in the ecosystem. Most companies and founders in Ethereum believed that Ethereum won, so now we just need to fight between all the Ethereum teams to see who can become the leader and decide things. Too many conferences, too many trips, too much time dealing with investors instead of being able to execute things. Debating and politics over building.

4. No new stream of blood. The stream of new blood has been decaying the last two years. People are aging, and we’re not being able to recruit new talent that stays for the long run.

5. No new big products like Maker, AAVE. This is related to 3 and 4. We don’t attract talent that is end-user focused. Our main wallet has had a UX from the beginning of the 2000s.

6. Trading, memecoins, DeFi seen as a sin. We forgot who is paying the bills. Personally, I’m not a big fan of trading, but I know it’s one of the main use cases in crypto. The only two real products in crypto for now are trading and stablecoin payments. I’m more in the second camp that loves stablecoins and ETH since I’m from a developing country and I didn’t even have money to trade until a few years ago. I see crypto as a way to escape financial repression in countries like Argentina. That said, fighting your users is never a good idea, even if you don’t like your users.

7. Talking about price is seen as something uninteresting. As an engineer and fan of research, I get why we’re like this. The thing is that the security of our network depends on price. The roadmap we have also depends on price: if we’re not one of the biggest networks in crypto, rollups aren’t going to settle in Ethereum.</title>
