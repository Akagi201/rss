        <title>RT by @0xstark: Agree here. 6/9 is a good step for pectra (not long ago it wasn&apos;t even in the cards), and the focus should then fully be on peerdas asap and with as much throughput as we can convince ourselves is safe, best if increasing by the full 8x &quot;sharding factor&quot;. No low value sidequests.</title>

There are many reasons Ethereum has flourished over the years, and Aya has played a significant role in that. She has a deeply strategic mind and a pure heart. Not many people have had the chance to work closely with her, but I have. My successes in Ethereum have always been complemented by her support and guidance.

Even if you want to see changes with the EF, and even if  your criticisms are valid, please look toward and help build a positive future. Please, put the pitchforks away.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Excited to announce that @ralexstokes and I are moving to the position of EF Research co-leads!

With this new role, I hope to accelerate pragmatic research for Ethereum and find more ways for us to involve the ecosystem in our many exciting projects.

What is EF Research?

Starting with a single original &quot;Research team&quot; at the Ethereum Foundation @ethereumfndn, a group of 5 teams has come to be known as &quot;EF Research&quot;. Today, these 5 teams are:

- Applied Research Group (ARG): Emphasis on getting research ideas into production, data engineering (the famous dotpics! https://dotpics.info) and specifications, with a new bend towards applied cryptography

- Consensus R&amp;D: The root from which more teams appeared, focusing among (many) other things on consensus, specifications of PoS Ethereum, and protocol-driven research

- Cryptography: A team involved in delivering cutting-edge, secure cryptography for use by the protocol. See also https://crypto.ethereum.org

- Protocol Security: Wide range of expertise to keep Ethereum safe, from code reviews to advanced tooling, simulations and bug bounty programs. See also https://github.com/ethereum/protocol-security

- Robust Incentives Group (RIG): A team concerned with the mechanisms and economics powering the Ethereum protocol. See also https://rig.ethereum.org

What changes now?

- Our aim with Alex is to ensure that EFR is always at its best, internally and externally. Alex and I are starting a new team named &quot;ResearchOps&quot;, focused on supporting the incredible work done by members of EFR, and more broadly on the delivery of research for Ethereum and its community.

- I am moving away from my role as team lead of RIG. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and RIG is not done yet. To continue this work, @casparschwa is taking over as team lead, I’m excited to see where he takes the group and its members!

What&apos;s next?

For me the direction is clear: Build a world computer for all to use. This means a censorship-resistant L1 at the efficiency frontier, and scale for L2s to onboard as many economies as we can imagine. Some big ticket items are of course SSF, DAS, EL R&amp;D, FOCIL, ZK, PQ… you know the list :)

Research is part of this process, and researching in public for Ethereum and its community is close to my heart. We’ll be experimenting with different ideas, and we&apos;ll also keep our ear to the ground. My DMs are always open to chat, and feel free to AMA in the replies here.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: PSA: I joined the Ethereum Foundation Leadership Team last week.

I joined the EF Research team in mid-2017, starting by contributing to the early sharding proof-of-concept. Over the years, my focus has been on L1 R&amp;D, and that will remain my core area defense. I&apos;m also passionate about Ethereum community building and enjoy bridging core research with the broader community.

The new @ethereumfndn handle is the beginning of the EF establishing more transparent communication channels. I&apos;m excited to collaborate more closely with Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi), Josh Stark (@0xstark), and Bastian Aue, and to dedicate myself to contributing to EF Leadership. My specific remit within EF Leadership hasn&apos;t been defined yet, but as my role becomes clearer, I&apos;ll share more details about my responsibilities.

As I transition from my previous Consensus R&amp;D team lead role, the internal task handover is well underway. The new EF Research team leads, Barnabé Monnot (@barnabemonnot) and Alex Stokes (@ralexstokes), are helping with the process. For my public-facing responsibilities, Justin Traglia (@JustinTraglia) will step in as the lead maintainer of the Consensus Specifications. I&apos;m not going far! To my longtime L1 collaborators, please feel free to reach out. 🫶

A heartfelt thank you to everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem who has collaborated with me on this journey. Special thanks to Vitalik and Aya for their trust and support. And to EF Research: I love you 4844 times.

I&apos;m excited to see how EF and Ethereum will continue to grow and evolve—and I am fully committed to nurturing and cultivating Ethereum&apos;s future.
