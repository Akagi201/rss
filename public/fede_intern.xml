        <title>RT by @fede_intern: With 30k lines of code and all dependencies in the same repository our Ethrex execution client has just successfully snap sync @ethereum Mekong testnet after 6 months of work. We‚Äôre also using our EVM (levm) that is another 10k lines of code. We have learnt a lot by reading and looking at geth codebase.

We‚Äôre refactoring the p2p code. I highly disliked the concurrency model we were using and what we had. The team is currently rewriting it using @commonwarexyz. In only 3 days we got the basics working. In 3 weeks maximum we should have the refactor done.

Then we will focus on performance. Performance is one of our areas of expertise. Its the thing that I‚Äôm the least worried about. Minimalism, security and good architecture are the things I want to have from the get go.

We will make sure we‚Äôre the fastest, most minimal and future looking rust execution client in @ethereum.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: We have started a big refactor of the P2P module. We are rewriting most of the codebase using a different concurrency model, the actors model, following Erlang design principles. For now, on the discv4 side, we have the ping-pong already working and the other messages under development and testing; on the RLPx side, the handshake&apos;s auth and ack already work as both receiver and initiator. We are currently debugging our first implementations of FindNode and Neighbors messages of discv4 and refactoring the RLPx part. In parallel, we keep making progress on snap syncing Holesky. We were able to successfully snap sync Mekong testnet.

- Added connection state to Kademlia table
- Refactored discovery service  
- Updated Hive version in preparation for Prague hardfork
- Several refactors and fixes for the snap sync
- Skip state sync if already completed
- Fixed adding public network configs to docker build
- Refactored P2P handshake and improved logging
- Improved storage download queue management during snap sync
- Started storing known peers in a JSON file
- Fixed avoiding disconnection of peer when receiving invalid transactions
- Added Mekong testnet presets

In the LEVM front we continued with refactors and benchmarking. We&apos;ve added some simple benches and we are now working on adding a mainnet block execution benchmark. On the refactoring side, we&apos;ve made an initial cleanup and made general improvements to our codebase. This lets us start designing how we are going to extend our current EVM implementation so that it can be used by ethrex L2 while in parallel we identify bottlenecks and fix them.

Changelog:
- Added more benchmarks to our suite
- Refactored the main module</title>

Ethereum needs less kumbaya aligment politics and more milady on the culture side of things and more Musk type of delivery.</title>

        <title>1. The @ethereumfndn holds only a small portion of ETH‚Äôs total supply. Even if they sold everything they had, it wouldn‚Äôt significantly affect the price, since ETH is widely held by many different actors. This broad distribution is a good thing.
2. The Ethereum Foundation pays researchers and protocol contributors, so it needs to sell some of its tokens to fund this work. I don‚Äôt see that as a problem in itself.
3. Expecting the Ethereum Foundation to become run like a startup is misguided. What you want in research groups is freedom and long term thinking. Startups are the opposite. We need both in Ethereum. That said, I do think there are many groups inside the EF that don‚Äôt have very clear goals and people in those groups don‚Äôt know what they are doing. I have spoken this with multiple people inside the EF and outside and most agree on which ones aren‚Äôt doing much.

Overall, the real issue with Ethereum isn‚Äôt that the Foundation might sell a few million dollars of ETH. The problem is that there‚Äôs a lack of urgency in most companies building Ethereum. Too many conferences, politics and not enough delivery.
Culturally we also have a big problem, there is a sense by everyone that only insiders are heard, with ideas only considered if they come from the ‚Äúaligned‚Äù group. I do think this is partially true. We thought we won and we entered the politics and alignment era rather than focusing on delivering.

Mixing alignment politics with VCs and engineering is obviously gonna be inefficient. The engineering of aligned groups is gonna be sold as top notch even if it isn‚Äôt. The politics are not gonna be related to solving concrete problems but to holding power long term to be able to invest in the next wave of ideas.

Even with all this going on, the Ethereum Foundation is one of the few organizations in Ethereum that actively opens its doors to newcomers.

Even if the EF changes it leadership and changes how things are done internally and even if it doesn‚Äôt sell 1 ETH I don‚Äôt believe that would have a huge impact on what is happening. It can for sure help, but the problem is deeper.</title>

        <title>I hope Ethereum community understands at some point that part of why we‚Äôre losing is because of the kumbaya virtue signalling and aligment politics. 

Virtue signalling, aligment politics are way worst that respectful debate. The first is inefficient and long term unsustainable. Embrace disagreement and being able to question others.</title>

        <title>R to @fede_intern: Another example of this is that people say that BNB, Avalanche, etc are just copy cats of Ethereum.

That‚Äôs what made Ethereum powerful: people copied it. You want people to copy your things. At the end clients always want to work or use the original.</title>

        <title>This is my biggest criticism to @OpenAI but also to @RiscZero and @0xLita. I think @Starknet had a similar issue.

I believe that by keeping models and code private people couldn‚Äôt build on top, change it and make it viral. The motto of these companies isn‚Äôt the code. I‚Äôve been saying this for years.

I think @Optimism and @SuccinctLabs in this way have been smarter. They understand better the dynamics of software distribution.</title>

I have zero sympathy for him or the team over there. I‚Äôm glad that this is all going open sourced. It should have been open sourced, and it‚Äôs better for humanity, and the fact that the Chinese did it to Sam Altman is comeuppance for the fact that he stole everyone else‚Äôs content.

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Let me tell you all a little story. Sometime around a or so year ago i reached out to an openai staffer who will not be named who had implied they would be very interested in doing some things open source

So, as any good representative of open source, i went to all the people i knew working in open source, and asked them all what things could openai do opensource that they would like to see. I collected maybe 15 bullet points, and gave that list to the staffer.

6 months goes by with no response. So i say whats up lets go? And nothing. So i emailed sama himself. And ya know what‚Äôs even? He responded! And setup a meeting with a high level research director.

We had an hour long conversation where i went through every item on the list, and he mostly shot every single one down. Mostly for not aligning with their business goals, some with hmm we will consider its. Said if they come up with any ideas they‚Äôd reach back out. 

This was like 6 months ago now, and ive never heard back. Since then, i simply gave up trying with them. I gave them all the reasons i could as to why they would benefit from it, but went on what at least at the time was deaf ears.

Here is that list again @sama since you seem to have finally seen what i was thinking, thanks at least for answering the email.

- Open source your models or at least legacy and deprecated models
- Research papers on what has worked for OAI, GPT-4 information such as architecture etc
- Opensource datasets for IFT/RLHF/Toolformers/Plugins/FunctionCalling/Web Browsing?  (Addendum, reasoning)
- Provide preferential access channels for vetted OSAI groups.
- Vet internal research for release, with prerogative to release as much as possible, even if on a delay commensurate with business goals and safety concerns.
- Have official townhall type meetings with major open source projects/teams
- Tools to filter data
- Contribute directly to public open source AI projects.
- Plug &amp; Play RLHF training code/Reward Models
- Alternatives to Text Models (Voice/Music/Image/Video) (preferably OS)
- Open sourced moderation classifier model/Classification Model&apos;s dataset
- Base gpt-4 model access for researchers
- opt in to removing the gpt4 moderation
- Release roadmap
- Opening up the ToS to make it unambiguous that training models on openai outputs are all good.</title>
