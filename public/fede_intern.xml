Other L1s shouldn&apos;t trash on Ethereum to create their own community. It&apos;s useless.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Agree with @fede_intern here. Ethereum is the only Global Layer 1. The world is moving towards a public-private model and for that to work there needs to be a secure and fully decentralized Layer 1. One without compromises. Major financial institutions and central banks are coalescing towards this model and Ethereum is King.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: We will also add the the GPU benches soon! It is probably what most people care about.

But sp1 4.1.0 seems to not run in a lot of GPUs though. I tried a couple ones and ended with the same error as the one in the issue 2021. As soon as there is a patch we can run it.</title>

        <title>Monad is not Firedancer for Ethereum in any way, shape, or form. This tweet implies that Ethereum, due to ego or an inability to make decisions, would refuse to use Monad‚Äôs codebase. However, Ethereum cannot use Monad, just as it cannot use Solana.

Monad is an alternative Layer 1 with a different consensus mechanism from Ethereum and design choices that are fundamentally distinct from Ethereum‚Äôs. While some of its ideas are highly valuable for Layer 2 solutions,and we will incorporate them in Ethrex, Ethereum itself will not adopt Monad. This is because Monad has completely altered Ethereum‚Äôs core design principles, which prioritize resiliency and availability over raw performance.

This tweet is misleading, crafted to draw attention to Monad by making an obviously incorrect claim. The only possible integration Ethereum could consider is using Monad‚Äôs execution client, but even that would not fundamentally change anything for Ethereum. In addition to that Ethereum doesn‚Äôt block anybody to use Monad execution client codebase.

This is yet another example of why I believe crypto VC investors create short-term incentives that harm the industry. It‚Äôs an attempt to undermine Ethereum just to make Monad appear more appealing.

I will continue to push back against any claim that Ethereum refuses to adopt something useful due to ego or political reasons.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Few comments from a quick pass 

* SP1 script &quot;executes&quot; and then &quot;proves&quot;, which adds extra time if you&apos;re just benchmarking on the time it takes to run the entire script e2e (seems like you are). Would advise removing the execution phase (since proving will re-execute).
* Would remove the json serialization/deserialization from the SP1 script as well: https://github.com/yetanotherco/zkvm_benchmarks/blob/main/fibo_sp1/script/src/main.rs#L61-L65

Probably what is most ideal is just adding the timing information around &quot;prove&quot; function itself vs. timing the entire script (which includes setup + client intialization which is usually cached on a server). I would add &quot;timings&quot; around this function: https://github.com/yetanotherco/zkvm_benchmarks/blob/main/fibo_sp1/script/src/main.rs#L39-L43

* groth16 times probably shouldn&apos;t be shown on the same graph as &quot;compressed&quot; times since it&apos;s net doing more work &amp; is a different computation
* Adding GPU benchmarking support, since that&apos;s how many use these zkVMs

Our benchmarking repo is here which has GPU support as well: https://github.com/succinctlabs/zkvm-perf</title>
