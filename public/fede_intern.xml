        <title>Disagree. The baseline of Ethereum was very low. Relative comparisons make sense up to a point.

I don’t agree with @aeyakovenko. Ethereum roadmap isn’t marketing but this isn’t the metric to show it. Gonna try answering him directly.</title>

        <title>Hard disagree with @ayyyeandy.

&gt;Hating on VCs is super midcurve behaivor.

I don&apos;t hate them but I do dislike most crypto VC and the incentives they have. I&apos;m mid then.

&gt; There&apos;s a reason why they take risks in size, with 5-10 year time horizons.

These are not the time horizons of crypto VCs and they don&apos;t take any risk. They manage others people money. In many other industries the GP needs to invest part of its own capital. In crypto this is uncommon.

&gt; However, some of them can be very predatory and narrative beta chasers with little technical knowledge.  You want to separate the right ones from the wrong ones as a founder.

You started saying that &quot;hating&quot; crypto VCs is mid curve. Now you are saying that some of them are predatory and beta chasers without technical knowledge. The question is if this happens only with a few of them or with the majority. Are you sure that the majority are not.

&gt; It&apos;s a privilege to be able to invest in new companies, even if 99% may not work out.  VCs bring a ton to the table. They bring legitimacy, resources, and distribution.
&gt; Retail on secondary markets bring buy pressure and more true native community building.  Your investors should work for you. As an investor, don&apos;t ask:  &quot;What can my bags do for me?&quot;  Ask:  &quot;What can I do for my bags?&quot;  Together we just might...  Make Crypto Great Again.

Most investors in crypto don’t provide any value. That’s the main problem. They don’t provide distribution nor legitimacy. They only provide capital. If founders could get capital from the public, they would. That’s why I disagree with Andy. If ICOs are back, most crypto VCs will have an issue. Not every one of them but most would be in trouble. It’s very likely we are at the top of the crypto VC industry. There will be a consolidation of VCs into a few of them.

I highly recommend reading @CryptoHayes’s take on the subject. He is a professional VC. I am not, but we did deploy 10 million of our own money and we got multiple offers from different parties to create our own VC with external capital. We’ve also raised from many and we know enough founders to understand how they get treated by many crypto VCs. We also work in other industries and can compare how VC and PE firms operate compared to crypto VC. I can assure you the bar in crypto is very low.</title>

        <title>These are the latest things we have been doing in Concrete, our linear type system programming language:
- Updated to MLIR/LLVM 19
- Cleaned up the crates, unifiying them into one
- Added an initial book and removed the workspace
- Refactored a bit the AST for Types and cleaned a bit the lower_types functions. (PR 152)
- Cleaned up and removed some &quot;pub&quot;s from the LALRPOP grammar, removing a lot of generated code and improving the cargo check times (for RA)
- Added the initial grammar for impl blocks</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: I’m worried that the US government debt problem will get so bad that the US will “go broke” and I believe that there are steps we can take to prevent it.  I am in the process of completing a comprehensive study about the mechanics of how countries go broke, where the US government is in its Big Debt Cycle, and what policymakers and investors should do about it.  The study will be published later this year as a new book: How Countries Go Broke: Principles for Navigating the Big Debt Cycle, Where We Are Headed, and What We Should Do. As with my prior books, I am going to pass along parts of it for free as I am writing, and I&apos;d like to discuss what it says with you and others on social media.
