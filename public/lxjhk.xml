        <title>thanks for the effort but i feel compelled to clarify the following:

we will not be compatible with Solidity or EVM. I am against any chain supporting multiple VMs. It hurts interoperability. I also find EVM inferior due to TPS bottlenecks and bad UX (approve and then swap, only a single instruction in a tx, ....)

1MM TPS yes but not 1.2MM which is not yet tested.

there is no SEVM (i don&apos;t understand what this is) and I don&apos;t have a way to make EVM -&gt; SEVM

there is no bridge between ETH and SOL. We are a scaling solution for Solana, transparent to end users which is a key innovation here.

we don&apos;t allocate assets dynamically. 
we do have an optimized solana validator with 100% mev kick back and 0% commission + sharing rewards + building more profitable blocks. so $ssol has the highest yield.

block production error rate &lt; 0.0001% ‚Äì no such claim

we are very different from eigen ‚Äì oh yeah, you&apos;ve got this right ‚Äì we redesigned from first principles to make sure the yield is organic

12 patents ‚Äì‚Äì no such thing ‚Äì i only have a pending one on efficient hardened derivation in mpc setting

chainlink wintermute ‚Äì  no no no no no, at least i have never spoked with them.

block production 40% more efficient ‚Äì hummm i don&apos;t understand the claim but i am gonna say no..

we don&apos;t have Baas. we are not partnering up with AWS in any way. we don&apos;t even use AWS.

we don;t have a LST bridge.... most of the tvl is just our liquid staking $ssol. we do a lot better in apy because of our validator optimization (which led to the chain)

again, no SEVM.... 

&quot;attracted 327 projects from ethereum&quot; - i wish. man. not there yet. more likely solana apps will flock over.

----

well i don&apos;t know what ai you are using... i recommend switching to a better one. 

but again thanks for trying</title>

        <title>some thoughts: SIMD-0096 is going to reduce the amount of tips going through Jito 

because it‚Äôs better to directly pay higher priority fees and not have to consider whether a Jito or non-Jito validator would be the leader. 

jito‚Äôs push for the tip router is to ensure there is still a way to take percentage cuts by standardizing block reward distribution.

jito offers two other benefits:

- bundles: this is gonna be unaffected for as long as jito validator adoption remains high
- anti-ddos: one overlooked aspect of Jito is that they operate a centralized transaction scrubbing center, allowing active validators to receive higher-quality transaction streams directly. This benefits validators in the form of more transactions included and higher block rewards. However, with the decreasing demand limiting their ability to take as large a percentage cut, a better monetization method may be needed.</title>

jito‚Äôs push for the tip router is to ensure there is still a way to take percentage cuts by standardizing block reward distribution.<br>
<br>
jito offers two other benefits:<br>
<br>
- bundles: this is gonna be unaffected for as long as jito validator adoption remains high<br>
- anti-ddos: one overlooked aspect of Jito is that they operate a centralized transaction scrubbing center, allowing active validators to receive higher-quality transaction streams directly. This benefits validators in the form of more transactions included and higher block rewards. However, with the decreasing demand limiting their ability to take as large a percentage cut, a better monetization method may be needed.</p>]]></description>
