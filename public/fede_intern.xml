        <title>RT by @fede_intern: With our security team at @FuzzingLabs we already reported 7 vulnerabilities to @ollama via @huntr_ai. Amazing work @Pat_Ventuzelo and team. We’re gonna be doing more work around LLMs and security with FuzzingLabs and development with Lambda.

Please do not exposed your Ollama server, it is not the only bug we found. The team will be sharing the other vulnerabilities as soon as possible.</title>

        <title>I agree with @AveryChing.

If you want big beefy fast blockchains @Aptos has better design than @solana but is more centralized. Move is a great language too. Way better than Solidity or Rust in Anchor/SVM. I’m an Ethereum guy but I recognize Aptos tech.

I have 0 aptos bags and I have exposure to solana companies, I’m saying this because I like Aptos tech. 

I will start buying at some point in time when I have more time to look into it. My focus right now is making Ethereum win on the long term.</title>

        <title>Since VCs are facing, and will continue to face, greater challenges investing in early rounds due to the rise of @echodotxyz and other platforms, and because high FDV rounds don’t generate real profits, the big players will shift toward trading, much like Brevan Howard. VCs with liquid funds will become even more mercenary. It’s just business.

The real problem is that you can’t have mercenaries shaping the future of an open, long-term protocol that is meant to remain unbiased.

Engineers and researchers are too naïve. They have no experience dealing with sharks.

If a protocol’s future depends on traders, the conflict between short-term gains and long-term vision will be inevitable.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: bump in the road, then stupids amount of printing. Trump won’t solve the deficit of the US. Even if he wanted, the US needs to have a deficit to export the dollar worldwide. This is the problem of having a global currency. I’m very bullish the US medium term. Europe is fucked with its policy of being an US ally and depending on their expensive energy. All talent of the west will go to US. The problem is that short term there are imbalances similar to the ones of Argentina during the last decades (with the advantage of not having debt denominated in other currency). They will have to print to solve it.

Gold, bitcoin, ethereum (i think it’s becoming very cheap relative to competitors) and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) to hedge. If you can buy a call OTM on an eurodollar contract or put on SPX or SPY OTM it’s a great idea too: volatility is super cheap relative to the problems.</title>

        <title>Shared bridges for a cluster of rollups or intent based bridges for rollups aren’t a solution for Ethereum liquidity fragmentation problem.

The two solutions work but:
- the first one is not a solution for Ethereum, so please stop presenting it as if it was
- the second one needs market makers and is not usable for any asset

We’re building the two but these are patches to the problem. Based native rollups with preconfirmations look like the most viable solution but I’m still thinking about the downsides.</title>

        <title>This is very bad advice:
1. If Uniswap did this it wouldn’t have won against Raydium, Raydium has been in Solana for ages. No chance of winning there.
2. It would have alienated its current base of users and it would have put its strength at risk.
3. Let’s see in a year or two if you’re right. I believe we shouldn’t be far away from a bounce in price and volume in Ethereum.</title>
