        <title>RT by @KAndrewHuang: The Bybit hack shows us once again that raw tx data in wallets is useless. There‚Äôs no reason hardware wallets shouldn‚Äôt decode and display transaction details in a human-readable way. 

It&apos;s honestly unbelievable that our industry has grown so much, yet we‚Äôve seen little progress on the hardware wallet side.

You‚Äôd think that crypto‚Äîthe only space where signing the wrong thing with just one click can cost you billions, with no way to recover‚Äîwould invest in providing clear, human-readable details on what you‚Äôre signing. Instead, we get a pile of unreadable hex.

And please don&apos;t get psyopsed by HW providers saying it can‚Äôt be done or that it&apos;s too complicated.

@sorellalabs, we already wrote code that decodes and classifies transactions at the trace level‚Äîshowing net token balance changes and displaying the entire transaction tree in a humanly readable format. This was done by a team of three.

This code could and should be used on hardware wallets so people can actually see what they‚Äôre signing. 

@ledger @trezor, what are you waiting for? Just fork it.</title>

        <title>RT by @KAndrewHuang: One underrated aspect of EIP-7702 is how it may make smart accounts practical on Ethereum mainnet for the first time.

Right now, it costs ~150k gas to deploy a smart account, which (assuming a gas price of 3 gwei) is about ~$1.20 on mainnet with today&apos;s ETH price.  For DApps who want to sponsor thousands of smart accounts, this is super expensive, which is why practically all of AA adoption has happened on L2s to date.

With ZeroDev Kernel 3.3 which supports 7702, the cost of deploying a &quot;smart EOA&quot; is now ~25k for fresh accounts (accounts with no ETH balance/txns) and ~15k for existing EOAs -- a 6-10x improvement.  This means you can deploy a 7702 account (aka &quot;smart EOA&quot;) for only 10 to 20 cents.

This scale of improvement is possible because Kernel implemented an important optimization where a smart EOA doesn&apos;t need to &quot;initialize&quot; itself when it uses 7702; the account logic automatically grants the EOA sudo access to the smart account.  Without this optimization, deploying a smart EOA would&apos;ve cost another ~70k gas.

Furthermore, a &quot;smart EOA&quot; can save gas by sending regular txns when it doesn&apos;t need to send UserOps.  For example, if a smart EOA wants to send a batched txn which doesn&apos;t need to be sponsored, it can just send a regular EOA txn to itself to trigger a batched execution -- no need to send a UserOp which is more expensive.

TLDR: With Kernel&apos;s latest optimizations, deploying a 7702 account is now 6x to 10x cheaper than deploying a regular smart account.  This means large-scale smart account deployments may become practical on Ethereum mainnet for the first time.</title>

        <title>RT by @KAndrewHuang: Today I&apos;m joining @CooleyLLP  as Special Counsel in San Francisco to support and advise founders that are forging the new tech frontier.

Building on the frontier is hard (think sectors like crypto, AI, hard tech, biotech). This is in part because the legal landscape can be complex and dynamic, making it hard to navigate.

At Paradigm, I saw many founders struggle to find the right team of lawyers to help them navigate the challenges their businesses face.

Working with crypto founders and investors on these challenges has made me uniquely equipped to help others navigate legal complexity, so they can focus on the technology they are passionate about.

But it‚Äôs not something any lawyer can tackle alone. I‚Äôve seen firsthand that Cooley is the best platform to support builders on the frontier. They are the leading law firm supporting companies in crypto, AI, biotech, and hardtech. This involves a full suite of experts in areas like securities and commodities regulation, governance, finance, hard and soft intellectual property, money transmission, and commercial transactions (just to name a few).

It‚Äôs a privilege to have the opportunity to join my good friend and former Paradigm colleague Rodrigo Seira (@RSSH273). The team at Cooley works seamlessly together to support founders on the frontier of crypto and beyond, and I‚Äôm ready to get to work.

I wouldn‚Äôt have seen this opportunity or been equipped to address it without the support of the team at Paradigm. The team at Paradigm has set the standard of how to build on the frontier of crypto and their leadership on the legal and policy front is the best in crypto.</title>
