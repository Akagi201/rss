        <title>RT by @0xTaker: Startups are about solving problems for people (and capturing a portion of the value associated with avoiding that problem). But that&apos;s too simplistic of a description

Startups are about solving problems for people. But more specifically, they are also about identifying the minimum problem that someone will pay you to solve, building something really crappy that solves that problem, and then charting a path that always bites off slightly larger portions of a bigger problem that solves more for more people, while improving the product and scaling up the business appropriately

Viewed in this light, startups are about navigating path dependency and charting a path that ultimately gets you to juggernaut pillar-of-the-industry status while building revenue and product incrementally in logical order

That seems obvious but lets take a simple example: Calendly

Calendly is a business that everyone immediately understands how to build. You need a google calendar integration, a web interface for scheduling / canceling, and some basic config management stuff

We all look at this and think &quot;I could build that but it would cost thousands of dollars of my time to do that so I&apos;ll happily pay $10/month&quot;. This is the core of the business

To launch a Calendly, you would build this first. You would build the absolute simplest version of the product, get users, and make sure they happily continue to subscribe. If it is really hard to get the first few users, then the thesis is invalidated, go back to the drawing board and solve a different problem

Assuming that the product has initial traction, you would now need to rank the list of possible improvements (in order of what is likely to grow the customer base the most). This could be based on reasons people chose not to enroll, or intuition, or whatver. In the case of Calendly maybe this is SSO support, or a better billing portal, or the Microsoft Teams integration, or a sleeker frontend, or hiring a sales team

If you choose well, this will grow your startup by a lot. If you choose poorly, it will grow the startup by only a little, or not at all (and will cost resources). This is part of what makes the startup journey fun. It&apos;s a game of wits

Startups are about finding initial pmf, and charting a course of growth that incremental and strategic. That makes sense. If you look at the codebase or employee roster of any big company, there will be millions of lines of code, and thousands of employees, and millions of dollars of revenue. But it&apos;s not very useful to look at it and plan to build all of that in order to replicate the level of success. The buildup of all of those features and team members, is only possible through careful strategic growth

In crypto, founders are expected to offer a compelling vision, which (more often than not) means describing that final state where there is a massively-adopted business generating tons of value and capturing tons of revenue

However, near-term tactics still require identifying much narrower problems for a small set of users that will rabidly consume the product, before incrementally expanding the capabilities

When I talk to a founder, I enjoy hearing their vision and definitely see the ability to clearly articulate a grand vision as being a helpful ingredient. But I am mostly asking questions to understand their near-term tactics - who is the user that is absolutely demanding to use their product? Why is that user not being served right now? How do you reach those users? What will you build next to expand the user base? - to understand how they will be able to get to that grand end state.</title>

        <title>If you were to make an electronic marketplace for authentic physical goods, what would you use?

Current stack I’m envisioning from the bottom up:
- Physical products warehoused with custody provider(s) for physical valuables
- RWA token issued to manage inventory levels and transfers; physical redemption / delivery is done when the owner has signed off on it and redeemed it on-chain with necessary info off-chain.
- Sales / transfers recorded on a rollup / appchain as a public ledger (e.g @conduitxyz @Calderaxyz)
- Sales are done in a single USD-denominated currency for ease in payment and price-action resistance; a balance may be accrued digitally in the payment token to track earnings and amortise CC fees (e.g @circle @Tether_to)
- Top-ups and checkouts happen via a credit card, wire or token swap that should be 1-step seamless (e.g @daimo_eth, @zkp2p, @OneBalance_io)
- Accounts and ownership are yours and yours only - only when you have signed off on e.g redeeming an item, will balance changes occur; refunds do not rewrite history but overlay on top of a previous transaction (e.g @privy_io @get_para)
- Transactions will most likely be sequencer-sponsored to alleviate thinking about gas.
- Listing and trading of items can be done via smart contracts (Etherdelta-style even) that achieve the intended exchange
- Each feature can be a new smart contract that builds upon the RWA and payment token e.g P2P many-to-many offers
- Prompting of permissions are handled by the wallet provider or by sessions (cc @ithacaxyz @gakonst).
- Anyone can index transactions and transfers for whatever functionalities they want to achieve: vendor bookkeeping, creating price checkers, investing strategies, history of ownership etc.
- Frontends can be built by merely just tapping into the public RPC or your own indexer.

Main consideration is to reach UX parity as much as possible with traditional websites (there shouldn&apos;t even be a need to mention the word &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;gas&quot;).

Would you make any changes? Any tech that you would use specifically?</title>

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: The vision of rpcX is to improve the conversation quality between client and server.

The client is the interviewer and the server is the guest. 

A well-designed API request means the interviewer can ask sharp, specific questions, and a well-designed API response means the guest can return accurate and specific responses

The Solana JSON RPC spec fails on both counts. The question to the server is vague, and the server can only respond with slop due to the lack of specificity.

rpcX solves the read layer problem by allowing the client to ask good questions and the server to provide good answers.

When UI clients ask for account data, they don&apos;t care about the encoded byte schema. They want application-specific data rendered to the screen.

When an Explorer asks for a transaction signature, it doesn&apos;t want encoded base58. It wants human-readable context for interpreting the on-chain state transition.

A programmable read-layer enables fluid client-server communication. 

It&apos;s up to the developer to figure out the details: call/response vs pub-sub, server-side vs. client-side data filtering, and network bandwidth management. rpcX provides the tools to have fine-grained control over this non-trivial tradeoff space.

The result? 

Highly responsive, lightweight applications that can power the future of on-chain finance.</title>

<br>
The client is the interviewer and the server is the guest. <br>
<br>
A well-designed API request means the interviewer can ask sharp, specific questions, and a well-designed API response means the guest can return accurate and specific responses<br>
<br>
The Solana JSON RPC spec fails on both counts. The question to the server is vague, and the server can only respond with slop due to the lack of specificity.<br>
<br>
rpcX solves the read layer problem by allowing the client to ask good questions and the server to provide good answers.<br>
<br>
When UI clients ask for account data, they don't care about the encoded byte schema. They want application-specific data rendered to the screen.<br>
<br>
When an Explorer asks for a transaction signature, it doesn't want encoded base58. It wants human-readable context for interpreting the on-chain state transition.<br>
<br>
A programmable read-layer enables fluid client-server communication. <br>
<br>
It's up to the developer to figure out the details: call/response vs pub-sub, server-side vs. client-side data filtering, and network bandwidth management. rpcX provides the tools to have fine-grained control over this non-trivial tradeoff space.<br>
<br>
The result? <br>
<br>
Highly responsive, lightweight applications that can power the future of on-chain finance.</p>
