        <title>RT by @letsgetonchain: Fighting consumes energy and brings people to the breaking point. This is part of the condition of life.

Do I feel good when I hear people from crypto twitter and VC firms telling me that PvP KOL degen casino that&apos;s money-losing for &gt;99% of its own users is the best product market fit that crypto is going to get, and it&apos;s &quot;condescending and elitist&quot; to wish for something better?

Or when people with no understanding of the ethereum foundation internals tell me exactly whom I should rip out of the organization and whom I should throw in, and on top of that expect it all to get done within 2 weeks?

No, I do not feel good at all hearing these things. There are even times when they make me feel emotional desire to quit. But each time that happens, I always see a sign from the world, something that reminds me that we are fighting for something valuable, that is worth fighting for.

If you look inside yourself, you will find things worth fighting for too.

Don&apos;t cancel yourself.
Become uncancellable.

        <title>RT by @letsgetonchain: Posting here part 2 which is more intended for devs.

I cover @ashekhirin pull request that added EIP 2537 to revm (rust implemention of the evm).

In this code deep dive you will get a good understanding of how precompiles work within the EVM!</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 4/ It means the execution layer can communicate with consensus, for example to cryptographically check that finality is reached for a certain block.

More generally these precompiles can be used by:

1) restaking protocols (@eigenlayer)
2) light clients
3) bridges
4) staking pools
5) zk tech

Others? please add!</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 3/ It makes it a good fit for much used cryptographic schemes like BLS Signatures for example.

BLS signatures are already used on the consensus layer due to its unique ability to aggregate many signatures and verify them efficiently.

What does this enable?</title>

        <title>R to @letsgetonchain: 2/ EIP 2537 introduces a bunch of new precompiles to the evm to handler operations on elliptic curve BLS12-381. 

The evm already supports some elliptic curves (like BN254) , but this one is pairing friendly and offers higher security than existing ones. 

Why is this important?</title>

Would you watch a stream where I run through their docs and build a dapp?  

Their onboarding is really cool compared to what I have seen before in L2 land.. Instant overview of what is available, account abstraction built in, live streams to connect with community..  

Don&apos;t fade a builder like @0xCygaar i guess..</title>

For example it&apos;s support for older transaction types lets you trace the evolution of fork-specific validations⬇️

Way more effective and sticky than reading EIPs.

Obviously implementing them is even better..

        <title>RT by @letsgetonchain: &quot;each marginal benefit that a chain has now will become eroded by the next one&quot; @__kfm__  that might apply to technological improvements. 

But it doesn&apos;t imo to Ethereum&apos;s decentralized and provenly credible neutrality. That reality can only be established with time and hence not competed away. 

This is essential since institutions do care about these features. Not because they value decentralization but because they need infra to be credibly neutral and not possibly influenced by some potential competitor more than others. This is a requirement for them to build on it in the first place. The internet if it wasn&apos;t a credibly neutral play for info exchange would&apos;nt have been adapted this way either. Instistutions can still have their own chains (L2s) but will use the base layer to handle asset issuance, conduct large scale defi and settle with other institutions. This is already taking place today and it&apos;s hard to see it not accelerate.

The competition you are talking about most likely will take place on these L2s.

When it comes to economics and value accrual to the base layer all the player building on top have a common interest to see value accrue to it. If they do not the benefit they get from the base layer erodes. You can see that incentive alignment already today with L2s signaling their support for the vision behind native rollups
