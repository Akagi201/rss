        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Every L2 benefits from the L1 scaling.

If L1 scales to the point an L2 can‚Äôt justify its existence, that‚Äôs a GOOD thing. It forces diversification and drives L2s to find differentiable value propositions.

Scale the chain.</title>

        <title>If big teams do this, be very careful in how you do it. You might alienate a lot of people if there is any party trying to take over.

With all the criticism that can exist towards the EF, they have been keeping things very balanced.

If this crisis is used by some interested parties (not saying Hayden is doing this in any way) they might break the toy they are trying to control.</title>

        <title>We need to explain why native based rollups (or just the latest design for rollups) is different than scaling the L1 directly. 

We need both. Scaling the L1 is the first priority to me. Bigger gas limit, shorter block times, more blobs, better price, more rollups settling on ethereum. Native based rollups for good interop and no multisigs.

It‚Äôs not tech anymore. It‚Äôs also culture. We need to show we can change things to be able to do better tech. The two things are intertwined.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Yep need to do both.

I think the tradeoffs are now gone since both DAS and zkEVMs are very near ready for prime time. Not scaling L1 using them is a choice and in our case, it will be a very expensive choice.</title>

        <title>Why? what‚Äôs the fascist part? There is a crisis. Vitalik is acknowledging the crisis. He is deciding how to change the organization that he created and is part of. I honestly don‚Äôt see the issue.

The EF is not the goverment of Ethereum. It‚Äôs also not the company building Ethereum. It‚Äôs one if not the only working foundations up to date in crypto

I‚Äôve been criticizing many of the things Ethereum has been doing. To begin with it lack of touch with customers and lack of speed and prioritization. I could even agree with that I don‚Äôt find, as an outsider, the EF particularly efficient in how it uses its money or communicates.

I can even understand and agree with some people not liking V‚Äôs tweet but how the hell can you say Ethereum is fascist for having one of its founders changing one of the many organizations of Ethereum after people asked for it.

The last few days I‚Äôve read strange takes. This is the strangest one.</title>
