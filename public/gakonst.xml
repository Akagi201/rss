        <title>RT by @gakonst: After the latest Reth bump, we could 3~4x the throughput limit on 2 test loads without breaking the chain!

Best bump ever and cannot thank the Reth contributors enough (especially in the last month).

        <title>Cross posting my 7702 answers from Warpcast to here because Tony from the Farcaster team asks good questions!

- not necessarily, you can forget the key and just replay the auth sig across chains, delegate to proxy and use the contract to handle upgrades. alternatively can store the privkey in cloud etc encrypted w enclave, nbd imho.
- unclear it matters, the ui will give you a preview over x-origin iframe, and your contract will have enough safety checks to ensure you don&apos;t get rugged. check secure payment confirmation web api if you really care about doing it non blind. 
- granted but not deal breaker, your contract can have multiple signers, need to be thoughtful about it but navigable, plus passkeys being pushed top down.
- session keys app/account interface is important to get right, see our work in porto for more: https://www.ithaca.xyz/updates/porto, and our WIP session key api which is still evolving: https://github.com/ithacaxyz/porto/tree/next?tab=readme-ov-file#keys
- zkemail is fantastic imo and totally underutilized. next up figuring out how to get google&apos;s certs reliably on chain as a public good, so we can do jwt verification for oauth.
- timelock or otherwise optional. can easily make your account say &quot;if an operation tries to transfer more than X value of such asset, request more auth keys (mfa) and also queue it up for 1mo in the future to ensure user can abort op if hacked from master key&quot;

we have put multiple examples on how to use 7702 and have deployed it on Odyssey, our devnet with Pectra + EOF, see below: 

https://github.com/ithacaxyz/odyssey-examples

There&apos;s also many examples / demos across Twitter if you search &quot;7702&quot;, see eg this one using &quot;anvil --odyssey&quot; which enables the same features Odyssey has but on Anvil (soon Anvil will be running same code as Reth via Reth SDK!)

https://x.com/thegaram33/status/1877410275814445170

There&apos;s more going on but this should be a good start for people! 

I cannot wait to show the world what full force crypto is, the stack is finally here and we&apos;re gonna lead the charge with our years of experience building the best open source tools.

It also enables solving intents for contracts that don&apos;t have a &apos;address onBehalfOf&apos;-like parameter in their functions.</title>

Today, weâ€™re releasing a deep dive on how Ethereum account delegation with EIP-7702 works, a spec for third parties looking to integrate, and a forkable codebase that you can extend to build next-generation wallets.

And, of course, a demo!</title>
