        <title>R to @0xstark: 19. @hyperdrive_box is an AMM for fixed rate yield markets, built on top of yield sources like stETH &amp; sDAI. 

This lets users earn fixed rate yield, or lock in fixed rates on existing positions from lending protocols, all while LP positions never mature.</title>

Centralization isn‚Äôt binary. What matters is the properties it gives you

A centralized sequencer can‚Äôt steal your funds as long as the exit window is open

        <title>RT by @0xstark: my summary fwiw:

Agree: 
- cross-L2 interop is broken today ü§ù
- we can and should move much faster ‚úÖ 
- goal is simple ‚Äì moving assets between chains with zero friction üèÜ 

Disagree: 
- we should put more resources into solving only &quot;cluster interop&quot;

imo the most ambitious + high leverage thing we can do is to bring the clusters together to find a pragmatic and efficient path to solving interop (months not years). It&apos;s a challenge. But can be achieved if driven by a balance of pragmatism and desire to achieve ambitious things for Ethereum. We can / must do it all. 

PS: I think we actually mostly all on the same page here. But Twitter makes it seem like we aren&apos;t :) Which can drive a wedge into interop. Lots of respect and appreciation for Uma, Succinct, and everyone jumping into interop efforts!</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: .@drakefjustin&apos;s work is incredibly valuable to ethereum&apos;s future, especially those of us who care about keeping the protocol decentralized and secure long-term and fighting against the zoo of technical bloat.

The beam chain roadmap got criticism for the &quot;2029&quot; date, but what that criticism misses is that the beam chain roadmap is a completely separate and parallel workstream from the work that is happening already to meet users&apos; needs in the short term (basically, scaling blobs, where @dankrad has for years played a leading and invaluable part)

In 2025, we need blobs (and L1 cost reductions like EIP-4444). In 2026, we need more blobs. @fradamt @dankrad and many others are heroes for pushing forward the research here. By 2030, we need other things:

* Long-term robust economics
* Long-term robust staking decentralization
* A clean and simple protocol, something worthy of a chain that aspires to be a neutral global base layer. This means zeroing out huge amounts of technical bloat
* Security (see also: https://verified-zkevm.org/ , which @alexanderlhicks has done a lot to get to its current state)
* Fully verifying light clients that can work on even the smallest devices
* Quantum-resistance (BTW this item is also one of the big reasons why &quot;no AA, just keep EOAs + 7702&quot; is NOT a valid option for ethereum long-term, we have to actually abstract the verification function as well, eg. see EIP-7701)

The beam chain roadmap delivers on all of these items.

It is a necessary complement to all of the important short-term work that we need to get done.

And in addition to the beam chain, @drakefjustin has been invaluable in helping the verified-zkevm team spin up, as well as all kinds of other cryptography and ZK initiatives.

We have excellent researchers and I am very proud of them. (And also excellent non-researchers)</title>
