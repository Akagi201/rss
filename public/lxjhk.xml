        <title>R to @lxjhk: In fact, this entire 2–3% trap exists so that Visa and Mastercard can create a narrow-waist market structure between businesses and consumers while effortlessly collecting the 0.15% card network revenue plus a fixed fee per transaction.

They encourage competition on both ends—card processing and card issuing—so that these players compete their margin away by giving it back to users (rebates) and merchants (volume discounts).</title>

        <title>imo, it will actually reduce payment processors’ margins due to lower barriers to entry.

To become a payment processor like Stripe, you need expensive licenses and compliance programs and must somehow get Visa, Mastercard, and banks to work with you. This makes it very difficult for new players to enter the market.

Stablecoin payments have no entry barriers—anyone can build them—turning it into a race to the bottom. Stripe will no longer be able to dominate the market as it does now. Instead, the market will be characterized by monopolistic competition.

Economically, the credit card system is one of the most stable financial models.

Users always prefer to use credit cards because of the 2–3% cashback rewards, non-monetary perks like rental car insurance, VIP lounge access, airline miles, and cancel-anytime protection.

Card-issuing companies actually don’t make much money from cards; they see them as a tool for user engagement and retention in their core business.

Merchants don’t like this, but so what? They have no choice but to price in the fees. Will I get a discount if you pay with stablecoins? No. The elasticity of demand—and therefore the burden of processing fees—varies depending on the specific goods and services in question.

Will I switch to stablecoin payments? No. I want my points, rewards, miles…

——

Also, to prevent market concentration, VISA and Master have enforced fragmentation across upstream and downstream value chains—for example, restricting sponsor banks to serving specific geographic regions.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: Turns out @cz_binance sent the first $TST buy tx to private RPC, but that tx still got leaked somehow. 

CZ&apos;s buy tx (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x84fba4557a3062ecfba9135cd75e95222a28dc24051f48fc9a4b750f1b24843e) set the minimum output to 363,225 TST, while at that block, he can receive up to 365,564 TST (~0.7% slippage). If this tx is not sent to the private RPC, then it can lead to a $200+ profit for the sandwich bot, and the sandwich bot must sandwich it. However, none did and the block builder payment was much lower than $200 at that block, so it is apparent that CZ used private RPC. 

The reason that CZ&apos;s buy tx failed was due to someone buying TST ahead of CZ (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x9b2b3b99536bbe167e84f7852c5617b41a0096e9676bc68876f78772b555364f). Unfortunately, this guy got sandwiched. Block builder prioritized this tx with sandwich txs over CZ&apos;s tx because the sandwich bot made $0.2 payments to block builder. If CZ set his gas price to 1.5gwei, his tx would likely be prioritized and succeed. 

The real suspicious thing is why would 0xB2d57876271eA8684e7c521c1265b87703d9A0DA (B1) know CZ is buying $TST in advance. The bot explicitly checked CZ&apos;s TST balance (if it succeeds) and attempted to backrun his transaction. Is the private orderflow shared with this bot? Maybe I am retarded and missed something, or I guess only the bot owner/block builder/relay knows.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: what happened with @Bybit_Official  just now?

1. hacker somehow constructed a tx to upgrade a bybit  wallet code to a malicious version. 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x46deef0f52e3a983b67abf4714448a41dd7ffd6d32d32da69d62081c68ad7882

2. hacker did a 90 USDT test tx to address under control
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x25800d105db4f21908d646a7a3db849343737c5fba0bc5701f782bf0e75217c9

3. 1 minute later, the hacker transferred 400k ETH to the same hacker address

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: yappers yap, builder build 💪

🙌here&apos;s @paladin_solana&apos;s new MEV port 🙌

TLDR
-normal Tx paying normal prio-fee
-drop on revert (like bundles)
-scheduler orders all Tx based on fees (no favoritism)

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: Hi, I’m meow from Jupiter, and I also cofounded Meteora.

Firstly, I’d like to reiterate my confidence that no one at Jupiter or Meteora committed any insider trading or financial wrongdoing, or received any tokens inappropriately.

Secondly, we are hiring an independent 3rd party (Fenwick &amp; West, one of the most reputable law firms in the world) to investigate and issue an report which they will publish independently.

Thirdly, I stand by Ben and his statement. I believe him when he says there was no financial inappropriateness in dealing with partners.

Meteora has been operating as a separate entity from Jupiter for over a year now and Ben has been running it without my significant involvement. He has done a great job building up the team, the most innovative DEX in the past year and the most active LP community in the world.

While I am 100% confident about Ben’s character,  as a project lead he has also shown a lack of judgement and care about some of the core aspects of the project (given its current size and reputation) over the past couple of months.

And this is unfortunately unacceptable. Ben understands this, and has chosen to resign. Going forward, we will be looking for new leadership for Meteora.

Ben has been an extremely helpful and kind participant in the ecosystem for a while now, as many people can attest. I ask everyone not jump to conclusions and be as kind to him as possible as he seeks to clear his name.

&gt; JUP, Jupiter, Me

JUP has been the gold standard when it comes to token transparency. We are the only major protocol to ever account for every token over the course of 3 audits. We have never sold tokens OTC and every single major token use is carefully documented and planned in our audits. Token integrity is key to us since the very first day.

Secondly, Jupiter is one of the most non-extractive players in the ecosystem. We have allowed users to swap tens of billions for free and our partners to make hundreds of millions of dollars in fees with minimal take on our end.

Over the last year our perpetuals fees are transparently documented, reported along with the two best audit partners in the space. Even our recent Ultra Mode is the first time we are charging users for swaps, and at 0.05%-0.1%, it’s 10x-20x lower than other main platforms.

Vast majority of fees are kept on Solana and invested in jupSOL/JLP and stay within the ecosystem, other than amounts used to fund talent acquisition and operating expenses. 

On my end, I have not sold a single JUP, nor do I regularly trade memecoins. I have been offered free tokens many times for marketing, and I’ve always rejected every single one. I diamond hand most of the tokens that I received from investment / advisory in the past prior to Jupiter. 

&gt; Watershed Moment For Crypto

I would like to apologize for the recent stress caused to the team, the community &amp; the ecosystem as a whole.

Even though we hold very high standards for ourselves for token integrity at Jupiter, I want to apologize that we haven’t held other projects in the space to the same standard.

This is a watershed moment for our industry and it’s very very obvious to me now that the way to grow the industry is not simply via more tokens but to have projects that have the same level of token certainty, long-term alignment, and extreme transparency like we practice with JUP.

One of my main goals will be to create permissionless products, operating systems, and ethical standards that I believe can form the new foundation of crypto moving forward.

1. Making http://jup.ag the best decentralized platform
2. Building Jupnet as the network to connect everything
3.  Driving the certainty, alignment and transparency standards for our industry

I’m not perfect and I’ve learnt a lot of crucial lesson. I hope to take the lessons from this and the robust systems we have built for JUP to define the next major phase of our industry - growing up.
