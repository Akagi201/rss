Because ENS is built on Ethereum, anyone can use it or integrate with it (like @Warpcast_ or @GoDaddy), and users *actually* own their ENS name.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Just to fill you in: I left the EF last year due to health issues and in an attempt to clear my head after working my ass off exclusively at the EF and on Ethereum for seven years.

I stepped aside, and the EF and the broader Ethereum ecosystem moved on without missing a beat‚Äînew leaders stepped up, and the machine kept running.

I got the much needed time to reflect without being so close to the gears of the machine. In my reflections, I got excited about the EF potentially entering a new era, not a full departure from prior strategy and philosophy, but an evolution to meet the world as it is today and as it has greatly changed over the past decade.

I opened a dialogue with Vitalik and others at the EF about such changes and the possibility of being involved in this new era. These discussions started long before this past week and are ongoing.

I‚Äôm grateful for the overwhelming support I‚Äôve received from Twitter and many longtime friends and colleagues. However, some of the discourse has turned counterproductive. These are real people attempting to sort through and do what is best. With or without me, the EF is evolving and for the better. You‚Äôve been heard, but vitriol is ultimately harmful to this process.

I believe in a community that fights its battles with respect and reason. So, fight for what you believe in, but please take the high road.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Ethereum Foundation Treasury Update

The Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) has set up a new @safe 3-of-5 multisig wallet.

The wallet address is 0x9fC3dc011b461664c835F2527fffb1169b3C213e

An op has been initiated to send 50,000 ETH there, but be patient; due to signing delays, this will take a few days to process (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6872c97c571e26c6c1dc18999fd116a67ce23cefdecf1cfcf6fb58899ba7f4d7)

The EF will use this new wallet to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. We&apos;ve made a testing tx on @aave. Stay tuned!

Also, @safe has proven safe and has a great user experience, and we will transfer more of our funds here over time!

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Some points on this:

1. The current process of upgrading Ethereum IS BROKEN.  Builders need long-term commitments to capacity, otherwise they cannot build on Ethereum. They need to know what the plan is in 5 years.
So I hope that we can finally agree to timelines in the core dev process.

2. We nonsensically claim that L1 cannot be scaled and L2s are the only way.
This is a complete ivory tower perspective -- Vitalik already posted this 3 years ago, and with DAS and zkEVMs the ingredients are now ready: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html
There are limits to this, yes, but scaling it 100-1000x in a few years is completely possible.
This achieves many things that based/native/etc. rollups don&apos;t.
I think actually doing this and stopping to find excuses for not doing it is essential for Ethereum winning.

3. Not everything can be on Ethereum L1, whether the actual limit is 1k or 100k tps or maybe even 1M tps. For this it is still great to add lots of data availability and create a great Ethereum security zones for rollups, who are Ethereum allies and can use Ether and all other Ethereum assets trustlessly.
But we need to do it at a scale that actually matters. We need to get to our current target of one Megabyte per second in 1-2 years rather than 5, and then KEEP GOING. I am currently doing research on maximally decentralizing the networking DAS/Data Availability Sampling, but until that&apos;s done, adding Data Availability Provider nodes with higher requirements is a good solution that has the same security assumptions as optimistic rollups (one honest node).
Other Data Availability protocols are currently building for GB/s! Ethereum does not have to match this, but being at 1/1000ths is not good enough.
Some projects are openly stating already that they will never use Ethereum DA (and openly advertising with Vitalik&apos;s support! The irony). Being ok with that and still claiming that they are somehow &quot;Ethereum aligned&quot; is thoroughly un-ambitious.</title>

3. Not everything can be on Ethereum L1, whether the actual limit is 1k or 100k tps or maybe even 1M tps. For this it is still great to add lots of data availability and create a great Ethereum security zones for rollups, who are Ethereum allies and can use Ether and all other Ethereum assets trustlessly.<br>
But we need to do it at a scale that actually matters. We need to get to our current target of one Megabyte per second in 1-2 years rather than 5, and then KEEP GOING. I am currently doing research on maximally decentralizing the networking DAS/Data Availability Sampling, but until that's done, adding Data Availability Provider nodes with higher requirements is a good solution that has the same security assumptions as optimistic rollups (one honest node).<br>
Other Data Availability protocols are currently building for GB/s! Ethereum does not have to match this, but being at 1/1000ths is not good enough.<br>
Some projects are openly stating already that they will never use Ethereum DA (and openly advertising with Vitalik's support! The irony). Being ok with that and still claiming that they are somehow "Ethereum aligned" is thoroughly un-ambitious.</p>

        <title>R to @0xstark: 8. @Farcaster_xyz is a decentralized social media protocol.

Launched in 2020 by @dwr and @varunsrin, Farcaster enables a new kind of social media where anyone can build a client (like @warpcast_), and users can interact with onchain components called Frames.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: The concerns historically were (1) regulatory, (2) if EF stakes ourselves, this de-facto forces us to take a position on any future contentious hard fork.

(1) is less than before, (2) remains. There&apos;s definitely ways to minimize (2), and we&apos;re recently been exploring them.</title>
