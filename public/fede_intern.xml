        <title>I’ve never been more locked in in my life. I have more friends around the world, more wealth, knowledge, and companies than ever, but I don’t care about any of that. All I want is to make Ethereum and ZK succeed. Nothing else matters. I’m obsessed. I only believe in things I can do or change myself. I believe I can help Ethereum win. I think Ethereum will be one of the biggest skyscrapers humanity has ever built. It’ll be more important than AI in the long run.

I’m working 17 hours a day. I sleep 7 hours each night, no alcohol, no drugs, no hanging out with friends or playing around. I’m 36 years old, I have been always like this and now I’m more focused than ever. The most I do for myself is take long showers to think about how to connect ideas and improve at my job. I need to exercise more, but traveling makes it hard. My days are just: meetings, trips, reading papers, checking code, eating, sleeping, and making decisions all the time. Locked in to make Ethereum win. My team has the best people: they are my biggest supporters and critics. They work hard and have been with me for ten years. They’re smarter than me in so many ways. I’m just the one leading and making the calls.

Most of the things we’re doing with our team are fragmented and not public yet. we will start connecting them more and we will be the roaring force that will push ethereum forward. ethereum is and will be the best protocol humanity has ever created, it has the best optimistic and forward looking community with the best visionary in charge it could ever have. We need to get better at product, engineering and coordinating the social layer. We also need to get better in marketing and communicating things. We need to be more efficient and fight against those wanting Ethereum to become a company. This is exactly what I have done the last 20 years and I’m gonna do whatever it takes to help change course and win. It’s clear others are trying to help change course too. I will lead in the things I know and I will follow those that are better than me.

I’m so happy. Ethereum makes me believe in humanity and in the ability of humans to do good for friends, families, countries and the world.
Let’s build brothers and sisters. Let’s make the world a better place with science and technology.</title>

        <title>Last week in Ethrex L1 development we focused on getting Pectra through the finish line, to be able to support the upcoming forks in the testnets. We&apos;re finishing the last bits but should be ready for the Holesky update next week. We also fixed several issues across the board.

- Implemented EIP-2935 (Serve historical block hashes from state)
- Implemented EIP-7685 (General purpose execution layer requests)
- Implemented EIP-6110 (Supply validator deposits on chain)
- Changed sync default to full sync in post merge testnets
- Added `--dev` mode to simulate a simple consensus engine
- Add a fix that to avoid discarding peers that were already connected
- Refactored and removed some feature flags
- Improved negotiation of capabilities between peers
- Fix issues regarding peers abruptly disconnecting due to getting an EOF
- Refactored snap sync algorithm to start early storage healing and paralellize downloading of accunts
- Modularized sync code
- Added missing serialization for an EIP-7702 transaction
- Fixed returned capabilities when calling `engine_exchangeCapabilities`

LEVM
We made significant progress on EF Tests compatibility, particularly for pre-Istanbul forks. We&apos;re now down to approximately 600 remaining state transition tests to pass. Additionally, we&apos;ve begun implementing the necessary hooks for L1-&gt;L2 deposit transactions, which will enable us to transition the L2 to using LEVM.

Changelog:
- Improved test coverage across multiple test suites including `eip3651_warm_coinbase`, `stArgsZeroOneBalance`, `stBugs`, `stSStoreTest`, and `stCreate2`
- Fixed various test cases related to Byzantium, Constantinople, and Spurious Dragon forks

Performance 
We&apos;ve identified and started working on several key performance improvements for Ethrex (both L1 and L2). Our main focus areas include:

- Optimizing database flush operations by implementing batch processing for state updates post-block execution
- Implementing state snapshots to reduce trie traversal overhead during state queries
- Improving transaction filtering and ordering efficiency during block building
- Reducing mempool lock contention when handling high volumes of `sendRawTransaction` RPC calls

To better track these improvements, we&apos;re adding gas/s metrics to the node for monitoring execution performance. We&apos;re also developing a new I/O-intensive test contract to complement our existing CPU-focused fibonacci contract for more comprehensive load testing.</title>

        <title>Yesterday I tried making a sarcastic joke and nobody got it. They thought I was serious.

Today I thought somebody was being serious and I was joking.

I will not make any jokes anymore but I’m not sure I will be able to understand when others are making a joke 🙈🤣.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: 🚨 Something wild is happening at MakerDAO &amp; no one is talking about it.

• Emergency governance vote out of nowhere.
• MKR borrowing limits 2x overnight.
• Critics banned mid-vote.
• No clear reason why.

Is this a governance attack? A power grab? Or something worse? 🧵👇</title>
