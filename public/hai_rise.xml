        <title>R to @hai_rise: The bugs we fixed:
- Missed the beacon root contract transitions when the chain reorgs within an L1 slot.
- Infinity loop when the chain reorgs over an L1 slot.
- Invalid state transitions due to wrong pre-execution (state cache) handling when the chain reorgs.
- Mishandling of no_tx_pool.</title>

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: It&apos;s clear to me that @VitalikButerin has heard the feedback, he has shifted gears into wartime mode and istaking action

I just spent 2hrs on the EF preconfirmations call with top L2 and based infra teams all sharing their support for Native Based Rollups!

@drakefjustin presented a key message of inclusive for layer 2. Bottom line is Ethereum offers services to Layer 2s:
🔹DA (Blobs)
🔹Sequencing (Based)
🔹Native Execution

L2s can pick and choose what suits their usecase best, and all are welcome.

For example, @rise_chain will be a based &amp; native layer 2, however, we&apos;re using altDA!

This shift in gears comes with an opinionated stance on Based Sequencing, its potential for Layer 2s and as a service Ethereum can offer.

And he means business! (yes it was a call 3am for me)</title>

        <title>At @rise_chain, each performance-sensitive change to the RISE Stack (as &quot;small&quot; as an OP Stack config tweak or a cargo update in the EL) must undergo 2+ hours of benchmarking to see effects on chain stability, throughput, and user latency under load.

While I enjoy our bare metals and the decentralising deployment talks at Devcon, cannot help but feel grateful for the credits @googlecloud gave us as we spun the 6th benchmarking instance...</title>

        <title>Excellent read for anyone operating an OP-based rollup. 

Key takeaways:
- Reth&apos;s good!
- Still, its solution to DB compactions &quot;sacrifices&quot; historical proof and root calculation speed. Versioned Merkle Trees like Jellyfish and specialized storages like LETUS remain much superior to MPT and MDBX.

- Full nodes forking onto their chain can happen easier than one may think. Operations are as important if not even more than core Systems works 🙂.</title>

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: Popular L2s still don’t scale.

L2s can’t handle Solana-level throughput even if they wanted to, let alone a few thousand TPS. Significant growth threatens to exhaust Ethereum’s data throughput indefinitely.

Building for Gigagas performance requires a different approach, so RISE is building with Celestia underneath. 🦣

Celestia plays a pivotal role in enabling RISE to achieve Gigagas throughput, which is over ONE HUNDRED TIMES more performance than popular Ethereum L2s like Base.

Blockchain performance, especially transaction processing speed, has long been severely undermined by three major bottlenecks: 

Data Availability, Execution, and State Access; leading to many failed attempts at launching truly scalable blockchains.

With Celestia, high performance Data Availability (DA) is now possible:

• 1.33 MB/s on public testnet (expected on Mainnet in January), enough to handle Gigagas chains while remaining permissionless

• Cheaper transactions, with DA costs as low as $0.00002 per transfer

• A roadmap to 1GB/s of data throughput, including through new cryptographic breakthroughs like ZODA (https://x.com/celestia/status/1864012479980024278)

• Proven reliability after a year in production and nearly 25 chains posting data to Celestia today

While Celestia removes the DA bottleneck, RISE tackles the Execution and State Access bottlenecks. Together, this makes RISE chain’s Gigagas performance a reality - bringing unstoppable, extreme performance to everyone.

No more slow transactions, network congestion and high fees - even at mass adoption.

This isn’t just incremental progress. RISE chain removes the final barriers to scale, at extreme scale, and will enable onchain applications to outcompete their centralized counterparts:

• DeFi with CEX-level speed and liquidity
• Fully on-chain apps supporting millions of real-time users
• On-chain AI networks that run without congestion

With Celestia’s DA and RISE’s Execution and State Access breakthroughs, the Gigagas Era is here: reliable, decentralized, and over 100x faster.

The future of unstoppable performance starts now.

        <title>RT by @hai_rise: Reth v1.1.3 is out -- smol updates, but most importantly breaking changes in the library API, setting us up for Reth as a type-abstracted SDK for building nodes...similar to Cosmos SDK and Substrate, but for the Rollup-centric roadmap.

so far you&apos;ve been able to overload payload building, txpool, rpcs, the runtime w/ evm or other state transition functions, soon you&apos;ll be able to define custom transaction &amp; block types, setting up for innovation and unprecedented customization for both research and product differentiation

stay tuned!</title>

        <title>100%. 

Like with Rust traits, we should define minimal core methods that a meaningful program would call from the abstraction. We may tolerate some good-to-haves if they have good defaults. Otherwise, it&apos;s best to provide these extras in each different implementation.

The same is true for Reth! The current TransactionPool trait requires 44 methods! Several are for blobs that most L2s don&apos;t support. Or when PayloadJob asks for methods only relevant to block-building with slow block times. We either need to provide frictional implementations that we should not need, or panic and pray the Lord that underlying Reth will not call them in a new release.

Will suggest and upstream improvements 🫡.</title>
