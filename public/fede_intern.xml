        <title>The word default can be understood in many ways. The use cases where the amount of value at risk is high will settle in Ethereum. The rest will settle in other chains. Exactly as it’s happening with real world assets or stablecoins. Ethereum is the main chain where you put your safe assets.</title>

        <title>This is one of the worst takes I’ve seen in crypto.

I admire strong, driven founders. I’d invest in or work with any of them and probably argue with them too.

But Vitalik is in a league of his own. He’s more like a high priest: writing philosophy, working on the long-term vision of Ethereum, and testing cool new ideas. He’s weathered tough times when others would’ve quit. While many founders cash out and move on, he’s still tackling society’s hardest problems. Any project would be lucky to have him.

Ethereum’s problem isn’t Vitalik, it’s the lack of strong founders and new blood working on the L1 to build something bigger than a company.</title>

        <title>I don’t know what’s the issue. Is he taking care of your kids in a school? Or is he defending his project? Read any biography of any successful founder. Full wokeness = believing that a founder insulting implies anything about its future.

I wouldn’t react like that (unless you insult me first) but I think this has 0 correlation with @shawmakesmagic or whichever founder to be able to manage a company.</title>

Long Bitcoin,
Short @worldcoin.

I like the idea of sybil protection and in an AI world I believe human IDs will be crucial. I don’t believe worldcoin will be the solution and I think their valuation has always been delulu.</title>

        <title>What Vitalik is talking about is part of our core guiding principles in software engineering at @class_lambda.

We&apos;re big fans and users of OpenBSD and Suckless. We fully agree with their software development philosophy.

Suckless manifest
Many (open source) hackers are proud if they achieve large amounts of code, because they believe the more lines of code they&apos;ve written, the more progress they have made. The more progress they have made, the more skilled they are. This is simply a delusion.

Most hackers actually don&apos;t care much about code quality. Thus, if they get something working which seems to solve a problem, they stick with it. If this kind of software development is applied to the same source code throughout its entire life-cycle, we&apos;re left with large amounts of code, a totally screwed code structure, and a flawed system design. This is because of a lack of conceptual clarity and integrity in the development process.

Code complexity is the mother of bloated, hard to use, and totally inconsistent software. With complex code, problems are solved in suboptimal ways, valuable resources are endlessly tied up, performance slows to a halt, and vulnerabilities become a commonplace. The only solution is to scrap the entire project and rewrite it from scratch.

The bad news: quality rewrites rarely happen, because hackers are proud of large amounts of code. They think they understand the complexity in the code, thus there&apos;s no need to rewrite it. They think of themselves as masterminds, understanding what others can never hope to grasp. To these types, complex software is the ideal.

Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.</title>

We're big fans and users of OpenBSD and Suckless. We fully agree with their software development philosophy.<br>
