        <title>RT by @0xstark: The unsung heroes of Ethereum are the people behind testing and DevOps (like @ethPandaOps  and @elbuenmayini ). People are drawn to shiny things—new research, the next big idea—but often take the backbone of Ethereum for granted. Prysm encountered consensus edge cases in both Mekong and Devnet5 that could have caused a fork on mainnet if left unnoticed. These tricky edge cases are typically caught only through tireless effort of those dedicated to breaking things. Next time you see someone from Ethereum DevOps or testing team, don’t forget to say thank you—and maybe buy them a beer</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: epic sequencing call #17!

Many founders, including 10 rollup founders, shared their support for based and/or native rollups. Below are some their quotes. 1h45min YouTube recording coming ASAP :)

Part 1—based and native rollups

Ben Jones from @Optimism: &quot;Let&apos;s get this right. Optimism is willing to support based sequencing and native execution. It&apos;s wartime.&quot;

Nick Johnson from @ensdomains: &quot;You can count Namechain as based-pilled and native-pilled [...] and consider us fully onboard.&quot;

Jesse Pollak from @base: &quot;We need to scale and connect the Ethereum ecosystem and based sequencing and native execution feel like the tools to do it.&quot;

Tomasz Stanczak from @NethermindEth: &quot;Based and native rollups feel super aligned, they are what we&apos;re super excited about.&quot; &quot;We will be experimenting with Surge, based rollups, and FABRIC.&quot;

Hayden Adams from @unichain: [couldn&apos;t make it; see recording for my Unichain take]

Steven Goldfeder from @arbitrum: &quot;Diversity makes Ethereum unique [...] We need to find a common core - which is a native rollup, but not stifle innovation on top of it. [...] We&apos;re excited to contribute to this direction [...] All of us want Ethereum to win.&quot;

Fede Carrone from @class_lambda: &quot;Based? For me, it clicked within seconds&quot;

Ye Zhang from @Scroll_ZKP: &quot;Based sequencing is an important way to stay in the same economic zone with Ethereum. [...] Native rollups are a super interesting idea!&quot;

Part 2—FABRIC: Fabric to Accelerate Based Rollup Infrastructure and Connectivity

Drew Van der Werff from @Commit_Boost: &quot;FABRIC is a shelling point to coordinate and stitch together some of the fragmentation that has emerged&quot;

mteam from @Spire_Labs: &quot;Spire is devoting developer resources to native rollups.&quot; &quot;We believe that a unified set of standards based rollups will lead to greater efficiency in development timelines, bring down costs for users, and establish a compatibility zone which is why we’re excited to announce our support of Fabric&quot;

Daniel Wang from @taikoxyz: &quot;we&apos;ve been waiting for the FABRIC standards so we can work together and provide a full solution&quot; &quot;Taiko is willing to contribute to the Fabric project to make sure we can divide and conquer the problems&quot;

Amir Forouzani from @puffer_finance: &quot;Based rollups were a no-brainer for us, [...] so were native rollups.&quot; &quot;FABRIC just makes so much sense, [...] these standardization efforts are so important&quot;

Demi Brener from @OpenZeppelin: &quot;We see based rollups as a promising path towards scaling Ethereum and billions of user.&quot; &quot;We are supportive of the FABRIC efforts and are willing to contribute.&quot;

Sam Batternally from @rise_chain: &quot;I am here to voice my support for FABRIC&quot; &quot;the signaling from Ethereum that this is the direction scaling is going which will be huge to pull off and attract more builders&quot;

Vitalik Buterin: &quot;our community thrives on open source, open research [...] It&apos;s amazing to see all of this interest and willingness to work together on sequencing and interoperability</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Fantastic post which completely changed my thinking on native rollups.

There&apos;s an inherent tension in Ethereum between the following goals:

(1) Embrace diversity of people and opinions and enjoy the innovation that comes with it.

(2) Make Ethereum (and all of its L2s) feel like a single, unified ecosystem.

Ethereum is the only ecosystem today with dozens of independent (and independently funded!) core development teams building the protocol. This is a huge strength and the talent of the people contributing to Ethereum is unmatched anywhere.

But does this also create some tension? Absolutely.

While there&apos;s a lot that unites them, each L2 team has its own vision, its own goals, and its own tech stack. It would be a lot easier to build a single unified ecosystem with one spec (and even one developer team).

But if we did that, we&apos;d lose the diversity and innovation that makes Ethereum stand out. The EVM and Solidity emerged from Ethereum devs, but so did @CairoLang, so did @FhenixIO&apos;s FHE-powered EVM,  so did  @fuel_network&apos;s FuelVM, and so did Arbitrum Stylus which enables WASM/Rust/C/C++ programs on Ethereum. 

In Vitalik&apos;s words:
Instead, Vitalik advocates for taking the step to unify the Ethereum experience while maintaining its unique character and diversity. Some of this is in the form of concrete technical features like chain-specific addresses. But the bulk of this is deep coordination between teams,  finding common ground between them and working together to build interop tech that unites us.

Enter native rollups.

Before today, I was pretty bearish on the notion of native rollups to be honest, as the way I had heard them pitched was a push for all chains to become homogenous and unify around a specific implementation of the EVM.

I thought this was a bad idea because while it might make interop easier in the short term, it would stifle Ethereum&apos;s innovation in the long term. 

But Vitalik presented it a bit differently than I had understood:

The way I understand Vitalik&apos;s view of native rollups is kinda like &quot;refactoring&quot; code. There are a lot of rollups that utilize the EVM and we should coordinate around a standard for that. Rather than have each rollup build this out independently, we should factor out this common feature and even add more native support for these functionalities.

But importantly we should do it in a way that allows rollups to extend the VM, and build a culture that continues to value innovation. 

Native rollups doesn&apos;t mean that that everyone has to be homogenous; it just means that we should find the &quot;common core&quot; and build those components together so we can waste less time on reinventing the wheel. Some rollups may stop there and just use the shared code, while others will innovate on top of it, building custom execution environments.

There&apos;s still a lot of research that needs to go into &quot;can we do this&quot;. Can we actually build a &quot;common core&quot; rollup that enables innovation? What does this common core look like and how can we build it in a way that all existing EVM rollups can get behind it and benefit from it.

Yes, it&apos;s early days. Yes there&apos;s a ton of research to be done. But as a vision, I think this is fantastic and I&apos;m excited about the future of an Ethereum that&apos;s both interconnected and diverse.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: Etherealize launched just 24 hours ago

The response from the ETH and TradFi ecosystems has been nothing short of incredible

Players from the Ethereum app layer, the infra layers, the L2s, and from all parts of Wall St reached out — and want to help

It’s truly inspiring

        <title>RT by @0xstark: There is perhaps an analogy with weed here.

Ten years ago, to many weed represented freedom, and rebellion against sclerotic old order that denied self-sovereignty over our bodies. Then, weed became legalized, and &quot;official&quot;.

On that day, I remember my personal interest in weed dropping by &gt; 2x overnight.

And since then, public discourse is moving toward a balanced view of weed: it is much less harmful than alcohol and smoking, and has valuable medical uses, but it is also far from harmless, especially in its modern corporate hyper-optimized versions.

Crypto finance is similar. In the old order, @GaryGensler created a regime where tokens that give investors clear indication of what their rights are and where their revenue comes from is a &quot;security&quot;, but obfuscated &quot;governance tokens&quot; are potentially in the clear. This was a perverse distortion of incentives, and it is a key reason why @GaryGensler must never be christened as a hero, even among crypto skeptics. Everything that happened in crypto was in part a response, part compliance part rebellion, to these pressures.

Over the last year, we have been entering a new order. Now, the most powerful people in the world are cheering on the idea of anyone creating tokens for anything, at any scale.

And so now is the time to talk about the difference between sugar-high short-term fun that is unwise to recommend to newbies, and long-term fulfillment and wealth-building. It is not about &quot;fun is bad&quot;, it is about the equivalent of modern hyperaddictive cellphone games, versus chess or World of Warcraft.

Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation states.

This is in a sense the essence of d/acc: the goal is not to indiscriminately accelerate everything, including superintelligent AI and fentanyl, the goal is to selectively accelerate defense so that it can keep up with offense. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of cultivating our own sense of virtue. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of creating better alternatives.

In defi, we are already starting to see a return toward honest token-based fundraising that gives users clear understanding of what they are buying, bringing us the best of pre-2020-era ICOs while addressing their downsides. The @infinex_app patron sale, and the @Truemarketsorg NFT sale, are two examples of this, and I personally know of other examples that are soon to come.

There is a bright future of capital allocation mechanisms that can be built. Potentially, we can come up with ways to ensure alignment with community wishes as well as safeguarding important values like privacy, security, open standards and open source, that could be part of the incentive structure itself. Acceleration is coming either way; it is our task to choose the brightest possible vector.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: A lot of folks seem unsure exactly what the 5th circuit Tornado Cash news today actually is. It&apos;s good news though not the end of the story: a publication of the November opinion and mandate, remand to the district court for remedies. This should foreclose the possibility of en banc review by Circuit (which is good). Gov&apos;t could still appeal to Supreme Court although that might be unlikely at this point. District Court will still need to decide whether the remedy is nationwide vacatur (anyone in US can use immutable contracts) or more limited relief (plaintiffs can use contracts and other parties may need to bring their own suits). Nationwide vacatur is what we should be rooting for.</title>
