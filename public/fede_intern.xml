        <title>RT by @fede_intern: i think it is time to draw a distinction between memecoins and attention tokens

high follower account drops a CA = not a ”memecoin”

what’s the meme? you losing your money like bored ape holders losing their jpegs in 2021?

classify these differently, talk about them differently</title>

Does not address the sale of tokens

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Oh and Julian isn&apos;t going to get away with this.

He knows this himself. 

Bro is just thinking he would rather take his chances with the Singapore regulators than risk mob justice.

Best play is prob secure the bag and gtfo to Dubai.

        <title>I don’t hate Solana like many do in Ethereum; in fact, I actually like it. It’s a decentralized blockchain with a different vision from Ethereum and Bitcoin. It’s one of the few serious projects outside of those two, with a strong community of builders. While I don’t vibe with some aspects of its culture, I respect many of the people working on it and admire the engineering behind it. I also think it has real utility for multiple use cases, even though I personally prefer Ethereum’s design and ethos. I feel part of Ethereum but I don’t see Solana as our enemy, just as a competitor.

A few days ago, some in the Solana community jumped on the chance to blow a joke from Vitalik out of proportion. Vitalik has read a lot of history and philosophy and enjoys those discussions. After making the joke, he clarified that he wanted to spark a debate about capitalism and its definitions. I find those conversations interesting, but I don’t think now is the right time for them. I think Solana folks took the opportunity to damage Ethereum reputation because V did a bad joke that also wasn’t done in the best moment.

Likewise, I won’t use this moment, when teams in the Solana ecosystem have been involved in rug-pulling billions of dollars, to take cheap shots at Solana. I don’t believe Solana is just about extractive memecoins. 

That said, I do think its leadership is making a mistake by not calling out what some of its builders have just done. It would be great if you guys publicly criticize these things. We need more people in every community helping remove the bad players.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Didn’t realize saying “a few years” would be so controversial.

It takes awhile for all wallets and dapps to adopt this stuff. 

I think within the first 1-2 months of EIP-7702, many Ethereum users will be benefiting from it.

Just being realistic about the long tail of adoption.</title>
