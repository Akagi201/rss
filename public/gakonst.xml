        <title>Which non L2 EVM chains are not supporting EIP7702 in the next two months? IMO everything with an EVM should include that EIP ASAP to 100x UX for everyone. I can help, our team is an expert. LMK.

        <title>R to @gakonst: What was the bug?

EL clients had an issue where they forgot to add the correct Deposit contract address, which matters for Pectra Requests Hash calculation:
- https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/8346
- https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/8265
- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31247

Reth and Erigon were ok.</title>

        <title>Holesky and other testnets exist to find issues. 

Excited that Reth &amp; Erigon worked well, and IMO NBD for other teams. Shit happens. We fix and keep shipping as one team. Highly recommend Reth in prod.

Would it have been better had no client had a bug? 
Sure. 

Was the bug easy to find? 
Yes. 

Does it mean we should go slower? 
No.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: Two ways:

1) hire 3 A people to work remotely. You pay them a lot, and they will laugh at you if you tell them they have to work weekends because as a startup you simply can&apos;t afford paying for that. Then you let _them_ get turbo autistic and work non stop because they naturally crave ownership and are proud of their work.

2) hire a bunch of kids with no other responsibilities you need to constantly wrangle in an office. Some of them will turn out to be exceptional, most of them will have to be constantly micromanaged.

Both can work. You can&apos;t tell me 1) doesn&apos;t work because you&apos;ve never tried and the default is to brute force 2).</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: Agree to disagree on this one.

As someone intense to a fault who has to actually refrain from DMing people on weekends, guarantee you that location has nothing to do with it. 

The water cooler neural network thing I&apos;ve never bought. I&apos;m terminally online with some of my colleagues, and even with some people from the ecosystem I have no direct biz relationship with. IRC/discord/slack/whatever works. Write everything down. 

What you need isn&apos;t an office, but high agency people who care and feel like they&apos;re going to be rewarded for their effort.

I will agree that if you hire a bunch of inexperienced kids or people who just want a job and don&apos;t care, sure it might be marginally more effective to micro manage them from their desk.</title>

Scale the L2s. Upgrade the EVM. Decouple shipping from scoping from researching. Focus on scale. Lock scope ASAP.</title>

        <title>RT by @gakonst: With OP Succinct Lite, we now have a ZK fraud proof offeringâ€”perfect for customers that are ZK-curious and want to upgrade their fault proofs to a better solution (on the way to full ZK).

It is time we leave interactive fault proofs behind. 

They are dinosaur technology, and with the rise of performant zkVMs like SP1, there is no reason to maintain complicated codebases of 1000s of LOC devoted to inferior tech.

ZK Fault Proofs give us:
â€¢ A simple 1-step dispute process, which can allow for reduced withdrawal windows
â€¢ Greatly reduced bond requirements (from 1000s of ETH to 10s of ETH)
â€¢ Greatly simplified onchain logic and codebases for rollup frameworks
â€¢ A path to full ZK!
