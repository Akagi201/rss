The timeline is noisy with markets, tariffs, and a lot of pain. But we‚Äôre heads-down building the infra to unify Ethereum.

        <title>RT by @0xTaker: Gold Star Pok√©mon cards are some of the rarest and most sought-after cards in the TCG, but what makes them so special? 

I was curious, so I took a look at the history behind these cards! It all starts with shiny Pok√©mon. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®

Shiny Pok√©mon, or Pok√©mon with alternate color variations, were first introduced in 1999 on the Game Boy Color. In these early Gold and Silver days, there was less than a 0.02% chance of encountering a shiny Pok√©mon (outside of a scripted event). This made shiny Pok√©mon extremely rare and desirable. 

I personally remember encountering one for the first and only time - a blue flame Ponyta! It was a magical experience as a 10 year old.

That experience of chasing a shiny Pok√©mon expanded to the TCG briefly in Neo Revelation and Neo Destiny, and returned in the EX Team Rocket (2004) set with the gold star cards.

These new gold star cards featured shiny variations of the iconic starter Pok√©mon, Mudkip, Torchic, and Treecko. For these incredible cards, the average pull rate was roughly 1 card in every 2 booster boxes (72 packs)! 

While these rates were more favorable than encountering a shiny in-game, it still made the cards a highly desirable chase, which has only grown over time.

Subsequent sets released more of these gold star cards for popular Pok√©mon such as Charizard, Rayquaza, and Umbreon! These cards are now some of the most sought-after in the TCG.

For example, a PSA 10 Gold Star Rayquaza card is valued at upwards of $30,000!! ü§Ø ‚≠êÔ∏è

If you learned something from this post, please give it a share. I would love to do more of these types of posts if there&apos;s an interest for them!

What&apos;s your favorite gold star card? Post below!</title>

- Invites financialisation of posts
- Token doesn&apos;t mean much

A couple diffs I can see:
- Zora isn&apos;t a gatekeeper - market decides value / reward fn and ppl decide what to do
- Token don&apos;t mean much, unless you make use of interactivity / some attribution on Zora</title>

architecturally,
it&apos;s an embedded virtual machine in the evm,
it treats opcodes as defi protocol calls, and
it uses bigbrainchad.eth-like encoding.

ideologically,
searcher and solver cartels hoard the cutting edge of router technology.
there is no alpha among them, source is closed to snuff out newcomers.
but when closed source is status quo, open source is defiance.

as such,
the lotus is an educational resource.
the lotus is an integration opportunity.
the lotus bears the agpl-3 copyleft license.

study it.
modify it.
use it.

but whatever you do,
share it with your fellow peoples.
