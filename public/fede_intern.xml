        <title>RT by @fede_intern: This is delusional. “the appropriate forums”, the incapacity of accepting a simple mistake is surprising to me. I think this this shows how you work with criticism. 

Every big company shows their mistakes publicly and even writes blog posts about them. You didn’t even generated a CVE for each bug. 

With this last message I’ve changed my mind. I do believe you’re trying to just move forward and not care much about it. Next time I will make sure things are more clear and public. You just generated incentives for that.</title>

        <title>A few months ago the author of revm told me that we copied some code from him.   I didn&apos;t know, my tech managers didn&apos;t know. I publicly acknowledged it. I said sorry and I sent a message in slack to the people involved saying you are fired. 5 minutes afterwards they were out of of the office. Please don&apos;t tell me that I&apos;m just criticizing you for some strange reason. I can assure you if we had a security bug I would be tweeting about it like &quot;THANK GOD this was found by an honest party&quot;. Anybody that knows me knows that I would be doing that. I can be autistic but when I have a fight with somebody I make it super public. I&apos;m not gonna use different standards with another party just because it&apos;s another party. 

Ask any employee or partner. I&apos;m way more aggressive and harsh with any internal mistake than external ones.</title>

        <title>What this shows me is that some people in crypto don&apos;t like transparent public debates.

The problem with open source in crypto is that it&apos;s full of bullshit since you pledge alliance to short term incentives created by crypto VCs.</title>

        <title>So this is how the history goes:

1. We found two security bugs in @SuccinctLabs SP1 with @3miLabs @alignedlayer and @class_lambda. If you combine the two bugs you can create a soundness exploit and prove any arbitrary program. For example you can prove you have the private keys of somebody else. TLDR: proving-verifying is fully broken.

2. Succinct never posted in a blogpost, they never posted in X. We waited for 40 days.

3. I just publicly criticize them for not showing publicly the bug. I also said they managed all the rest very professionally.

4. The answer I get from John and Uma is that I am doing a criticism to them that I would not do to somebody else and that X is not the place to post security disclosures. This is a strawman argument. You can post it in a blogpost as almost any company does. What you did is you just avoided talking about a very relevant bug in the security product you&apos;re building.

5. My concrete criticism consists in:
a) Creating a github issue mixed with another bug is not the proper way to share a soundness bug with the community. If we were smaller less known company, people wouldn&apos;t even know that the bug exists. It&apos;s a relevant bug. In your position I would have released a blog post and written a thread in X. By putting the fix in a new version and not speaking publicly about it you&apos;re almost just discarding it.

b) The fact that your answered privately that user funds were not at risk because the prover is permissioned shows me that we live in two very different worlds. What happens if a developer is using your tech and you don&apos;t know about it in a permissionless way? What happens if somebody uses another exploit to hack the prover? We used two bugs to prove what we wanted, what makes another company not be able to use the two that were reported + another 0 day? The core idea of ZK is that you only need to trust the verifier/math.

a) and b) show me that ZK is not yet ready for massive usage yet. We can&apos;t still accept relevant problems. I hope we can learn before we have hackers stealing funds from common people. 

Everyone has security bugs. We&apos;re not better than you. The difference is that we would have accepted it very publicly and I would be sharing it publicly. There is nothing bad with it. Exactly as @zcash did with their inflation bug. Check next tweet.

I didn&apos;t have anything against you guys but I don&apos;t think any of this is serious. Particularly the way you handle a simple critic.

At last, you need to still fix the second bug. You have only fixed the first bug in 40 days.</title>

What happens if a developer is using your tech and you don't know about it in a permissionless way? What happens if somebody uses another exploit to hack the prover? We used two bugs to prove what we wanted, what makes another company not be able to use the two that were reported + another 0 day? The core idea of ZK is that you only need to trust the verifier/math.<br>
<br>
a) and b) show me that ZK is not yet ready for massive usage yet. We can't still accept relevant problems. I hope we can learn before we have hackers stealing funds from common people. <br>
<br>
Everyone has security bugs. We're not better than you. The difference is that we would have accepted it very publicly and I would be sharing it publicly. There is nothing bad with it. Exactly as <a href="https://nitter.freedit.eu/zcash" title="Zcash 🛡️">@zcash</a> did with their inflation bug. Check next tweet.<br>
<br>
I didn't have anything against you guys but I don't think any of this is serious. Particularly the way you handle a simple critic.<br>
<br>
At last, you need to still fix the second bug. You have only fixed the first bug in 40 days.</p>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng:

&gt;&gt; Studies machine vision at Zhejiang University

&gt;&gt; At 30 in 2015, launches High-Flyer quant hedge fund

&gt;&gt; Makes a fortune (now $8B AUM)

&gt;&gt; Wants to build “human” level AI as side hustle and pitches partners but they initially sceptical 

&gt;&gt; Buys 10,000 H800 chips in 2021 and brings over his top hedge fund employees (all have tons of experience squeezing juice out of Nvidia GPUs for the fund)

&gt;&gt; Launched DeepSeek in 2023 and hires dozens of PhDs from top Chinese universities (Peking, Tsinghua and Beihang)

&gt;&gt; Pays top top top salary for tech talent only matched by Bytedance in China…wants DeepSeek to be leading “local” company 

&gt;&gt; US export restrictions force DeepSeek team to get creative and they do, finding new training methods to make LLM models (V3, r1) competitive with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, LLama etc at ~1/20th the cost 

&gt;&gt; Training costs not exactly apples-to-apples but novel methods and clear improvements in efficiency (also questions around copying other models, larger H-100 clusters they maybe can’t talk about and/or CCP support)

&gt;&gt; Open sources and publishes methods (r1 reasoning paper has 200+ authors) 

&gt;&gt; DeepSeek just hit top of App Store

Running locally on CPU and RAM with llama.cpp after much trial, getting apx 3.4 tokens/sec.</title>
