        <title>RT by @fede_intern: I&apos;m pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed.  Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case. We were committed to fighting this suit until the bitter end but welcome this outcome. No company wants to be the target of agency enforcement, but at the same time, it was our duty and honor to stand up for blockchain software developers in the hour it was most needed, as I‚Äôm sure our industry peers who also stood up against regulatory overreach would tell you.

Devs both here at Consensys and across the space are building a better world and deserve to have someone in their corner fighting for their rights. That is why we sued the SEC when it became clear that Ethereum was the next target, a lawsuit that actually caused the SEC to drop their Ethereum investigation. Every legal and policy win might be hard fought, but each is an important step along the path to a better financial system and a better internet.

I am grateful to @MattCorva and our legal team for their exceptional work and the entire Consensys family, whose passion and commitment has never once waivered. We appreciate the SEC‚Äôs new leadership and the pro-innovation, pro-investor path they are taking. We will remain deeply engaged with public and private policymakers going forward. Crypto wants the U.S. to address the best interests of consumers and businesses alike, and we are already on our way to making that happen.

Now we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys. The paradigm shift to a much more decentralized world is accelerating.</title>

I believe this is the way forward for rollups to solve the interoperability in Ethereum. The are still work to be done and things to solve but we believe this is the step in the correct direction for @ethereum.

We‚Äôre also integrating this work in ethrex to use it in Rogue.</title>

        <title>saying that having multiple gateways in based rollups is the same than centralized sequencers is plain out wrong.

it‚Äôs like saying ethereum is centralized and the protocol use useless because there are two builders. 

one of the issues of crypto is that technical discussions are mixed with people raising money and tokens being launched. the technical debate becomes super bizarre and it‚Äôs more related to getting attention from CT.</title>

        <title>great. I‚Äôll take the same approach: I believe technical discussions should be grounded in substance, not ego.

for example, mteam, a few weeks ago, you expressed frustration that some of Ethereum‚Äôs leadership discussed based rollups publicly without mentioning you. you are also pushing back against Ethereum having a based rollups framework because you raised money to build one. Ethereum development cant be delayed because one party raised money to do something similar.

I‚Äôd urge caution here. letting ego drive the conversation can be counterproductive, especially in engineering and research debates.

I do think some of your criticisms have merit, but equating a gateway to a centralized sequencer is simply incorrect. I even agree with part of the criticism of Espresso but the difference is that in their case the discussion is more direct and clear. Beyond that, your argument contains several notable technical errors. That‚Äôs why I strongly encourage you to write a formal response, this would allow for a more structured debate and a meaningful exchange of ideas.

my anti ownage the term based arc has only just begun. i can also answer in the same tone. 

you‚Äôre young and smart. ethereum needs new blood and people like you but i would prefer we have a more civilized and serious conversation than this around the most important thing ethereum needs to do.</title>
