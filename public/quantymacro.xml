        <title>Idk much abt “Super ratio”, but may I perhaps interest you in something called “Multivariate Linear Regression”? where you have multiple features as inputs &amp; produce a single estimate of exp returns. also pls add ridge penalty.

follow me for more extremely advanced quant tips.</title>

        <title>on 14th Aug 2024, I had extremely profound thoughts on cross-validation, that warrants an article

normally when I have ideas I would write the outline so I don&apos;t forget things. but I didn&apos;t, because it was so profound I was sure I won&apos;t forget

now I completely forgot abt it</title>
