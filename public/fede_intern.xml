        <title>RT by @fede_intern: Stay away from high doses of turmeric. It’ll lower your DHT. Also, never take high (&gt;200mg daily) doses Ashwaghanda for more than a week to two… that can cause other issues. In fact, I would skip those two altogether. Ginger is not a problem.</title>

        <title>I wanted to publicly thanks @ercwl, @ballsyalchemist, @bkase_, @shaishav0x and @0xRodney.

The first three are honest builders that keep on raising the bar of the crypto industry. They have supported us and also criticized many of the things we do. We don’t agree in everything but that’s what makes life beautiful. I respect them because they give us feedback but at the same time they do an effort to understand us. There are not many like them. I hope crypto becomes closer to what they represent.

The last two are VCs that trust us and know that we have plans for the next decade. Most VCs in crypto are very short term sighted. They are part of our journey and they have provided us with contacts, ideas and have been nice to us when many have been jerks.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: I don&apos;t like the idea of national governments owning Bitcoin, and while US gov spending money on acquisition of BTC is far less bad than most of what it spends money on, I still prefer private money to be held privately. 

However, if a digital asset reserve is going to happen, I strongly believe it should be Bitcoin only. I say this as someone who obviously supports many crypto assets and projects. 

Bitcoin is, objectively, the most liquid, the most safe, the most trusted, the most decentralized, and the most conservative digital asset on Earth.

There is zero defensible reason to include any other digital asset in such a reserve, at least today. With time (years?), it would be reasonable to consider adding other things, but those are discussions to be had years from now.

Start with the strongest, most defensible foundation. Understand it. See what effect it has with some time.  Do not complicate the novel idea by adding the complexity and risk and noise of other digital assets. 

Bitcoin only, in this case, and at this time.</title>

        <title>RT by @fede_intern: While I’m excited about a Strategic Reserve, I was surprised by the digital assets being contemplated. Bitcoin is the only asset that meets the bar for a store of value reserve asset. Maybe Ethereum. Digital gold and digital oil. Which mirrors America’s physical reserves of gold (Fort Knox, NY Fed, etc.) and oil (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). It&apos;s possible other assets could make the grade in the future but it’s a very high bar.</title>

        <title>It’s sad, but I believe Bitcoin maxis were more right than wrong about many things in our industry. I always suspected this, but it’s becoming more obvious. This doesn’t mean I like Bitcoin maxis or that I’m about to become one. The main problem with Bitcoin maxis is that Bitcoin expels builders, while other communities—like Ethereum and its L2s/Restaking, Solana, Sui, and Aptos—welcome them. Almost every other project is just an obvious Ponzi scheme.

That’s why I really hope Ethereum can break free from the aristocratic and inefficient politics that are holding it back. If Ethereum can’t do so, the industry doesn’t have a promising future. I never thought the EF was the main problem, nor do I think things will automatically improve with more engaged leadership in the EF. The EF has always been an honest player with long-term incentives, trying to work with most people.

I’m optimistic but also cautious. People believed Ethereum was doomed, and now they think the problems are magically solved. Let’s hope for the best!</title>

- TRUMP coin: 9/10, completely unhinged, just a crazy move overall
- MELANIA coin: 6/10, kind of sad at this point, but it was the beginning of the end for memecoins and introduced us to kelsier which was funny so there are positives 
- crypto reserve feat ADA and XRP: 10/10, I dont even know what to say about this. a government bailout for your buddy who gets crypto news from tiktok. silver lining at least the maxis are upset
