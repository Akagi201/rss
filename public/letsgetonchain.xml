        <title>I really dig how @SOCKETProtocol made it possible to write your entire cross chain app in solidity. 

This is made possible because the off chain &quot;watcher&quot; server runs the evm.

Even though this cross chain coordination is async in nature which does not really feel natural in solidity you don&apos;t really need to think about it as an app developer cause its all implemented for you.

Advantages are pretty big imo:

1‚É£ With Foundry you get to very easily test your full stack (off chain + on chain state)

2‚É£ Since your on chain app is written in solidity no one else should write this cross coordination than the developers that wrote the on chain app. Switching to js for this with non native types, libs etc is a painful</title>

        <title>Most projects launch on Solana not for its composability, but simply because that‚Äôs where their audience‚Äôs funds are. 

Once chain abstraction is the norm, that advantage is gone.

        <title>When running multiple clients, does detecting a bug in less than ~12 min (before finalization) and shutting down enough validators running the buggy client (below supermajority), prevent bugs from becoming forks that need to be resolved through social consensus and instead resolve as a simple reorg? 

Seems like the importance to monitor and identify who is wrong as well as communicating that to the right validators in less than 12 minutes in order for them to shut down is really big. How does that coordination work ? @TimBeiko @sassal0x</title>

        <title>Reading up on this weekend&apos;s drama..

Solana&apos;s current fees have never given me reason to be bullish. Their business model is not sustainable. Anything should be valued on projected earnings. If you think squeezing billions out of retail every month is sustainable than yes you can use the current fees to forecast future earnings i guess..

The only reason I ever got interested in blockchain tech are its permissionless, trustless, and credibly neutral characteristics (whether for SoV use like Bitcoin or compute like Ethereum) that make it likely to be globally adopted. Solana has always felt to me like a semi-centralized run infra developed by a very centralised company. I personally never saw value in that eventhough I am sure that the top engineers at Solana push the boundaries of what that semi centralized infra is able to do. But the point is that you either go all in on the characteristics above or you do none of it. Instead of going of halfway might as well run a single node blockchain and still promise people to permissionlessly deploy their memecoins there.

Things I‚Äôve never really seen (maybe my timeline is an echo chamber‚Äîlet me know who to follow to change that):

- Forums, twitter threads where the equivalent of EIPs get passionately discussed in Solana land by brilliant people worldwide
- Energetic open source activity on clients / tooling etc like we see in evm land (like Foundry, Ape, etc. ).
- The kind of grassroots dev activity I see in replies on accounts like @optimizoor or @gakonst. Some reports say Solana dev activity is massive, but I‚Äôm only seeing meme coin launches, not 0-to-1 primitives.

Happy to get corrected by @0xMert_ @aeyakovenko or anyone else who can point me to the right people to follow to change my perspective. I want to see that wider, community-driven engagement at the infra and app layer, not just in-house ‚Äú10x engineering‚Äù work to get excited about anything in Solana land to believe it has a credible path to acquire the characteristics mentioned above over time.</title>

Did a video for every EIP in Pectra that directly affects the EVM. For each EIP: 

- I discuss its overall purpose 
- delve into every line of code that‚Äôs modified in the EVM implementation

Playlist link üîó in second tweet!
