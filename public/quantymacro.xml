        <title>on 14th Aug 2024, I had extremely profound thoughts on cross-validation, that warrants an article

normally when I have ideas I would write the outline so I don&apos;t forget things. but I didn&apos;t, because it was so profound I was sure I won&apos;t forget

now I completely forgot abt it</title>

        <title>we listen and we don’t judge

up until today I had no idea what my notice/non compete is, or the difference between the two. I did read the contract a few times before but I still didn’t understand and I was too scared to ask.

but today I found out what they are</title>

        <title>RT by @quantymacro: looked through some student CVs for quant roles. IMO a quick (&amp; extreme) heuristic is that if your experiences can also be written in someone else’s CV, they’re too vague/not specific enough

“utilised ML techniques to develop quant strategy” isn’t rly saying anything.
