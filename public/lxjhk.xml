        <title>RT by @lxjhk: We @shoucccc @tonykebot found a critical vulnerability in http://time.fun last week and conducted a hack. The vulnerability allows hackers to steal all trading fees and modify metadata (e.g. change &quot;toly&apos;s minute&quot; to &quot;vitalik&apos;s minute&quot;) of every tokens launched. 

As the issue has been resolved, here is the full disclosure:

http://time.fun provides each new user with a dedicated wallet to deposit USDC for trading. User&apos;s private key is securely stored in a third party provider. But SOL is needed to cover gas fees and http://time.fun wants a seamless interaction for users, the wallet “HW2C...Lo1H” signs every trade transaction alongside the user’s wallet signature. Surprisingly, this same wallet also owns all tokens launched by http://time.fun. As it is one of the signers, we can act on behalf of “HW2C...Lo1H” if we can let the backend sign arbitrary data.

We discovered that by forging a token, it was possible to trick the backend into believing it was signing a legitimate transaction—letting us change metadata or withdraw all funds from “HW2C...Lo1H.” We reached out to the team (through buying 1 minute of their founder on http://time.fun) meanwhile did a whitehat hack. The team responded and fixed quickly and we returned all the funds.

All backends should never sign transactions coming from the frontend, regardless of how thorough the validation or simulation checks appear. These safeguards can be bypassed by obfuscating transactions or bundling/front-running transactions to alter their semantics.</title>

        <title>R to @lxjhk: In fact, this entire 2–3% trap exists so that Visa and Mastercard can create a narrow-waist market structure between businesses and consumers while effortlessly collecting the 0.15% card network revenue plus a fixed fee per transaction.

They encourage competition on both ends—card processing and card issuing—so that these players compete their margin away by giving it back to users (rebates) and merchants (volume discounts).</title>

        <title>imo, it will actually reduce payment processors’ margins due to lower barriers to entry.

To become a payment processor like Stripe, you need expensive licenses and compliance programs and must somehow get Visa, Mastercard, and banks to work with you. This makes it very difficult for new players to enter the market.

Stablecoin payments have no entry barriers—anyone can build them—turning it into a race to the bottom. Stripe will no longer be able to dominate the market as it does now. Instead, the market will be characterized by monopolistic competition.

Economically, the credit card system is one of the most stable financial models.

Users always prefer to use credit cards because of the 2–3% cashback rewards, non-monetary perks like rental car insurance, VIP lounge access, airline miles, and cancel-anytime protection.

Card-issuing companies actually don’t make much money from cards; they see them as a tool for user engagement and retention in their core business.

Merchants don’t like this, but so what? They have no choice but to price in the fees. Will I get a discount if you pay with stablecoins? No. The elasticity of demand—and therefore the burden of processing fees—varies depending on the specific goods and services in question.

Will I switch to stablecoin payments? No. I want my points, rewards, miles…

——

Also, to prevent market concentration, VISA and Master have enforced fragmentation across upstream and downstream value chains—for example, restricting sponsor banks to serving specific geographic regions.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: Turns out @cz_binance sent the first $TST buy tx to private RPC, but that tx still got leaked somehow. 

CZ&apos;s buy tx (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x84fba4557a3062ecfba9135cd75e95222a28dc24051f48fc9a4b750f1b24843e) set the minimum output to 363,225 TST, while at that block, he can receive up to 365,564 TST (~0.7% slippage). If this tx is not sent to the private RPC, then it can lead to a $200+ profit for the sandwich bot, and the sandwich bot must sandwich it. However, none did and the block builder payment was much lower than $200 at that block, so it is apparent that CZ used private RPC. 

The reason that CZ&apos;s buy tx failed was due to someone buying TST ahead of CZ (https://bscscan.com/tx/0x9b2b3b99536bbe167e84f7852c5617b41a0096e9676bc68876f78772b555364f). Unfortunately, this guy got sandwiched. Block builder prioritized this tx with sandwich txs over CZ&apos;s tx because the sandwich bot made $0.2 payments to block builder. If CZ set his gas price to 1.5gwei, his tx would likely be prioritized and succeed. 

The real suspicious thing is why would 0xB2d57876271eA8684e7c521c1265b87703d9A0DA (B1) know CZ is buying $TST in advance. The bot explicitly checked CZ&apos;s TST balance (if it succeeds) and attempted to backrun his transaction. Is the private orderflow shared with this bot? Maybe I am retarded and missed something, or I guess only the bot owner/block builder/relay knows.</title>

        <title>Re Bybit x SAFE, there are so many attack vectors: browser plugins (AI, bot, wallets, etc), dependency poisoning, etc.  

The end signer has to attest to the full effect of the transaction before singing.</title>

        <title>RT by @lxjhk: what happened with @Bybit_Official  just now?

1. hacker somehow constructed a tx to upgrade a bybit  wallet code to a malicious version. 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x46deef0f52e3a983b67abf4714448a41dd7ffd6d32d32da69d62081c68ad7882

2. hacker did a 90 USDT test tx to address under control
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x25800d105db4f21908d646a7a3db849343737c5fba0bc5701f782bf0e75217c9

3. 1 minute later, the hacker transferred 400k ETH to the same hacker address

4. as well as 800mETH, 90k stETH, and 15k cmETH
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbcf316f5835362b7f1586215173cc8b294f5499c60c029a3de6318bf25ca7b20

5. the hacker quickly distributes assets into different addresses, trying to escape
