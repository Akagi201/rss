        <title>I’m not rich but thankfully I make enough money to not get too upset if I forgot to bring my water bottle and had to buy water at Sainsbury

next year my dream is to make enough to not get too upset if the restaurant sells still water for £5</title>

        <title>2024 reflections: career edition. as a junior quant macro tradooorrrr (warning: long)

the good, the bad, &amp; the ugly

I like my job. I&apos;m lucky I like my job. and I&apos;m super lucky that what I like, also happens to pay enough as a career. hope I can continue doing this a bit longer

1) at first like most juniors, I was hit with our old friend Mr Imposter Syndrome. but I think I overcame it. my strategy was to find (1) important workflow of the team that aligns with my strengths, study the *hell* out of it, until I become the go-to person for anything related it.

and I did that. now when I feel bad about not being able to do X, I tell myself &quot;it&apos;s ok I can&apos;t do X, but I&apos;m the person who knows best about Y here&quot;. sounds like a cope, but hey it works. ofc at the same time I try to improve on areas that I&apos;m not strong at.

2) naivety of youth is a blessing. before I joined the industry, I did a bunch of personal projects, and one thing that I let flourished was my creativity. I tried a bunch of the most random things for the sake of trying stuffs out.

when you join an experienced pod as a junior, there might be a tendency to kill your own creativity. bcs you think “ah surely they have thought of this” or “surely if this works someone else would have found it”. but no. never assume, always verify.

3) an experienced team has its own way of finding, combining signals, building portfolios etc. and they tend to stick with those.

a corollary of this; unconventional strats that do not fit nicely into those frameworks are ignored. as a junior with fresh eyes, you can explore those

most of the time I didn&apos;t find anything, but one time when I did, it helped to boost our Sharpe by 14%. ngl I&apos;m proud of that bcs I was doing an independent research, outside of our pre-existing frameworks, and it paid off. hopefully I can find more of those in the future (amen)

4) things take longer than you expect. as a junior, I have a tendency to try to do things fast &amp; shoot from the hip (overcompensate for lack of competence)

but a good manager knows that anything worthwhile takes time. if the thing might make $Xmm of PnL, it&apos;s unreasonable to finish it in an hour.

often this &quot;junior rush&quot; is self-imposed, and I ended up being sloppy + produce subpar work so these days I try to go slower.

inspect intermediary outputs, plot many things, look at them a bit longer etc. valuable insights take time to materialise, try not to rush things.

5) 20s syndrome is real &amp; unproductive. it’s where you think obsessing about the future will get you there faster

“when am I gonna be associate PM?”
“when will I hit my X figures?”
“when can I buy a house?”
“should I be interviewing on the side for better pay?”

I think it’s fine to have those thoughts, but it’s way more important to focus on your craft instead of obsessing about the future. and it’s just good to live in the present.

that&apos;s all I guess. I also have a rough list of things I wanna focus/work on next year but idk it&apos;s getting too long so maybe one day. happy new year friends</title>

        <title>for better or worse, AI is filling in the gaps quite well. not perfect ofc, but still it helps a lot. the fact that I have unfettered access to a decently smart assistant is a game-changer. the bad news is I still haven’t made new friends lol</title>

        <title>given that it’s Christmas, I’m gonna share free alpha.

there are *huge* alphas that you can tap into if you run your strategies in unconventional timeframes instead of the typical ones (1m/30m/1h) etc

extremely few know this. merry xmas</title>
