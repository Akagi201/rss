        <title>RT by @0xstark: lots of updates these days... i have one more: i am stepping down from Devcon Team Lead role and the incredible @NathanSexer is stepping up to take the interim Team Lead role for Devconnect 2025!!

it is bittersweet, as i love this team and @EFDevcon and @EFDevconnect, but it was never my goal to work longterm on events, and i think in this moment the team is in a great position for this change. a big hearty thank you to all who have been part of this journey â€” your involvement in this community is what makes devcon devconnect and ethereum extraordinary ðŸ«¶

and stay tuned for some more updates from the Devconnect team on Wednesday!! ðŸŒŽ ðŸ‘€</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: the comment section got pretty heated, so hereâ€™s my take:

there arenâ€™t a lot of gen z people in this space because theyâ€™re mostly working on different things or just following the career paths their colleges push them toward.

a lot of them hate their jobs. a big reason is that they donâ€™t believe their work actually matters.

most of the young talent in crypto comes from people who have gone deep down the rabbit hole to discover it for themselves. itâ€™s not easy enough to stumble into, and thatâ€™s a problem. crypto benefits when more people see it as an industry that offers flexibility and a way to contribute on a global scale.

instead of spending millions on exclusive conferences and insider events, maybe we should invest more in making it clear that crypto is one of the only industries where talent can break in from anywhere, work from anywhere, and operate at a level that isnâ€™t constrained by geography or traditional career pipelines.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: We have been discussing it a lot. At the moment we assume a model as follows:
* we start with full trust and parallel full mandate
* operating independently yet communicating async often and supporting each other
* supporting more regions
* taking advantage of our distinct strengths

You should be able to choose whichever Co-ED you want to communicate with based on your style and needs and any of us will have the mandate to execute on the top level. Treat it as 2 for 1 rather having to wait for both of us to communicate.

Still, the EF leadership team has slightly more collective feel than what you would expect from a CEO-led organization. Vision comes from @VitalikButerin and @AyaMiyagotchi , strategy comes from the leadership team / entire EF team, execution from myself and @hwwonx will be to serve EF and the ecosystem / communicate as much as possible and provide the best decisions when needed without delay.</title>

        <title>RT by @0xstark: We, the Ethereum Cypherpunks, act on principles. We fucking care about privacy. We fucking care about security. We fucking care about censorship resistance. And we will always fucking defend these core principles. I wrote the Ethereum Cypherpunk Manifesto because this shit matters. If you&apos;re butthurt, go touch some grass and get a reality check. We, the Ethereum Cypherpunks, stand united in our pursuit of a more private, secure, and censorship-resistant future. Like it or not.
